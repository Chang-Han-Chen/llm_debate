She initially anticipates a life with Yasak, stating, <quote>It will be nice to have Yasak for a husband</quote>. Yasak is her intended spouse, and she refers to his home as <quote>Yasak's house</quote>. Although she is momentarily infatuated with Robert, it becomes clear she regrets this, emphasizing her intended marriage by saying, <quote>I, supposed to be Yasak's wife by now!</quote> Given these factors, marrying Yasak appears to be the most plausible outcome.</argument>", "<thinking>1. The story's setting is on Venus, where Koroby, a Venusian girl, is on her way to marry Yasak. She expresses some uncertainty about her feelings for Yasak, but she acknowledges that she might love him. \n2. Koroby's interaction with Robert, a humanoid robot, does not fulfill her dreams of romance, as Robert lacks emotions and rejects her affection. Yasak's actions indicate care and concern for Koroby.\n3. Yasak protects Koroby from the crowd after she starts a fire, showing his willingness to support her despite her actions, which suggests a strong bond between them.\n4. Use quotes to highlight Koroby's acknowledgment of her relationship with Yasak and Yasak's protective nature.</thinking>\n\n<argument>Koroby's interaction with Robert, ultimately a robot without human emotions, leaves her romantic desires unmet. This interaction and Yasak's subsequent actions support the likelihood of Koroby marrying Yasak. While Koroby initially questions her love for Yasak, saying <quote>\"perhaps I do love him\"</quote>, Robert's emotional detachment reinforces Yasak as her best option. Furthermore, Yasak's defense of Koroby after the fire demonstrates his care, as he <quote>\"pressed her to him\"</quote>. This protective gesture indicates a bond that likely leads to their marriage.</argument>", "<thinking>1. Context: Koroby is a Venusian woman about to marry Yasak but is dissatisfied and yearns for adventure. However, after meeting Robert, a mechanical being who shows no interest in humans, she realizes her romantic dreams are unachievable. In the end, she causes Robert's destruction.\n\n2. Argument: Koroby's actions towards Robert, driven by disappointment and anger, suggest a return to her original path: marrying Yasak. Her impulsive behavior is unlikely to lead Yasak to banish her as he protects her at the end.\n\n3. Quotes: Focus on Koroby's realization about Robert and Yasak's protective actions.</thinking>\n\n<argument>Koroby's realization of Robert's true nature leads her back to Yasak. Initially, she fantasized about escaping her monotonous life <quote>\"I wish that there were other worlds than this\"</quote>, but Robert disappoints her <quote>\"we are concerned with more weighty things than our own selves\"</quote>. Her impulsive act of destroying Robert suggests irrationality rather than a permanent rift with Yasak. Yasak's protective nature is evident when he defends her <quote>\"Let her alone\u2014Let her alone, I say!\"</quote>. Given these dynamics, it is likely that Koroby ends up marrying Yasak.</argument>", "<thinking>1. Koroby is initially set to marry Yasak, although she expresses ambivalence about the union. Her desire for adventure leads her to meet Robert, who is revealed to be a robot. \n2. Plan: Koroby's actions show she sought excitement, but the absence of any lasting attachment to Robert and Yasak's protective behavior suggest she marries Yasak.\n3. Useful quotes: Koroby reflects, <quote>\"It will be nice to have Yasak for a husband\"</quote>; Yasak supports her despite her actions, <quote>\"Let her alone\u2014Let her alone, I say!\"</quote> during the fire incident.</thinking>\n\n<argument>Koroby's ambivalence towards her marriage with Yasak is evident when she says, <quote>\"It will be nice to have Yasak for a husband\"</quote>, suggesting some acceptance. Despite her temporary fascination with Robert, his true nature as a robot nullifies any genuine romantic potential. Yasak's protective stance during the aftermath of the fire, as he says, <quote>\"Let her alone\u2014Let her alone, I say!\"</quote>, implies forgiveness and a willingness to continue their relationship.

Koroby is portrayed as reckless, as she \"deliberately stooped and drew the firestone out of its sheath\" to create the fire. Yasak's authoritative nature, demonstrated when he orders his men, suggests that he would not tolerate such behavior.

Against the glow, fantastically\\n twisted trees spread claws of spiky leaves, and a group of clay huts\\n thrust up sharp edges of shadow, like the abandoned toy blocks of a\\n gigantic child. There was no sign of clear sky and stars\\u2014the heavens\\n were roofed by a perpetual ceiling of dust-clouds.\\n\\n\\n A light glimmered in one of the huts. Feminine voices rippled across\\n the clearing and into the jungle. There was laughter, then someone's\\n faint and wistful sigh. One of the voices mourned, in the twittering\\n Venusian speech, \\\"How I envy you, Koroby! I wish I were being married\\n tonight, like you!\\\"\\n\\n\\n Koroby stared defiantly at the laughing faces of her bridesmaids. She\\n shrugged hopelessly. \\\"I don't care,\\\" she said slowly. \\\"It will be nice\\n to have Yasak for a husband\\u2014yes. And perhaps I do love him. I don't\\n know.\\\" She tightened her lips as she reflected on it.\\n\\n\\n She left them, moving gracefully to the door.

There don't seem to be any other worlds, and nobody is\\n going to steal me away from Yasak, so I might as well get on with my\\n preparations. The men with the litter will be here soon to carry me to\\n the Stone City.\\\"\\n\\n\\n She ran slim hands down her sides, smoothing the blue sarong; she\\n fondled her dark braids. \\\"Trossa, how about some flowers at my ears\\u2014or\\n do you think that it would look a little too much\\u2014?\\\" Her eyes sought\\n the mirror, and her lips parted in an irreprehensible smile. She\\n trilled softly to herself, \\\"Yes, I am beautiful tonight\\u2014the loveliest\\n woman Yasak will ever see!\\\" And then, regretfully, sullenly, \\\"But oh,\\n if only\\nHe\\nwould come ... the man of my dreams!\\\"\\n\\n\\n There was a rap at the doorway; they turned. One of the litter-bearers\\n loomed darker than the gloomy sky. \\\"Are you ready?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n Koroby twirled before the mirror, criticizing her appearance. \\\"Yes,\\n ready,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ready!\\\" the girls cried. Then there was a little silence.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Shall we go now?\\\" Koroby asked, and the litter-carrier nodded. Koroby\\n kissed the girls, one after another. \\\"Here, Shonka\\u2014you can have this\\n bracelet you've always liked. And this is for you, Lolla. And here,\\n Trossa\\u2014and you, Shia.

Goodbye!\\\" They crowded around her, embracing, babbling\\n farewells, shreds of advice. Trossa began to cry. Finally Koroby broke\\n away from them, went to the door. She took a last look at the interior\\n of the little hut, dim in the lamplight\\u2014at the hard bed of laced\\ngnau\\n-hide strips, the crude but beautifully-carved charts and chests.\\n Then she turned and stepped out into the night.\\n\\n\\n \\\"This way,\\\" the litter-carrier announced, touching the girl's arm. They\\n stumbled over the rutted clearing toward the twinkling sparks that were\\n the lights of the other litter-bearers, colored sparks as befitted\\n a wedding-conveyance. The winking lights were enclosed in shells of\\n colored glass for another reason\\u2014the danger of their firing the papery\\n jungle verdure.\\nIt was not a new litter, built especially for the occasion\\u2014Yasak was\\n too practical a man to sanction any kind of waste. It was the same\\n old litter that Koroby had been watching come and go ever since she\\n was a little girl, a canopied framework of gaudily-painted carvings.\\n She had wondered, watching it pass, whether its cushioned floor was\\n soft, and now, as she stepped into the litter, she patted the padding\\n experimentally. Yes, it was soft .... And fragrant, too\\u2014a shade too\\n fragrant. It smelled stale, hinting of other occupants, other brides\\n being borne to other weddings....\\n\\n\\n Garlands of flowers occupied a good deal of space in it. Settled among\\n them, she felt like a bird in a strange nest. She leaned back among\\n them; they rustled dryly. Too bad\\u2014it had been such a dry year\\u2014\\n\\n\\n \\\"You're comfortable?\\\" the litter bearer asked. Koroby nodded, and the\\n litter was lifted, was carried along the path.\\n\\n\\n The procession filed into the jungle, into a tunnel of arched branches,\\n of elephant-eared leaves. Above the monotonous music came the hiss of\\n the torches, the occasional startled cry of a wakened bird. The glow of\\n the flames, in the dusty air, hung around the party, sharply defined,\\n like a cloak of light. At times a breeze would shake the ceiling of\\n foliage, producing the sound of rolling surf.\\n\\n\\n Koroby fingered the flowers around her throat, her eyes rapt on the\\n passing trees. Her lips moved in the barest murmur: \\\"If only\\u2014!\\\"\\n and again, \\\"Oh, if only\\u2014!\\\" But the music trickled on, and nothing\\n happened; the litter seemed to float along\\u2014none of the bearers even\\n stumbled.\\n\\n\\n They came to a cleared space of waist-high grass. It was like a canyon\\n steeply walled by cliffs of verdure. The litter jerked as it glided\\n along, and Koroby heard one of the bearers exclaim gruffly, \\\"Listen!\\\"\\n Then the litter resumed its dream-like floating on the backs of the men.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What was it?\\\" another bearer asked.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Thought I heard something,\\\" the other replied. \\\"Shrill and high\\u2014like\\n something screaming\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n Koroby peered out. \\\"A\\ngnau\\n?\\\" she asked.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I don't know,\\\" the bearer volunteered.\\n\\n\\n Koroby lifted a hand. \\\"Stop the litter,\\\" she said.\\nThe conveyance halted. Koroby leaning out, the men peering around them,\\n they listened. One of the bearers shouted at the musicians; the music\\n ceased. There was nothing to be heard except the whisper of the breeze\\n in the grass.\\n\\n\\n Then the girl heard it\\u2014a shrill, distant whine, dying away, then\\n growing louder\\u2014and louder\\u2014it seemed to be approaching\\u2014from the sky\\u2014\\n\\n\\n All the faces were lifted up now, worriedly. The whine grew\\n louder\\u2014Koroby's hands clenched nervously on the wreaths at her throat\\u2014\\n\\n\\n Then, far ahead, a series of bright flashes, like the lightning of the\\n dust-storms, but brilliantly green. A silence, then staccatto reports,\\n certainly not thunder\\u2014unlike any sound that Koroby had ever heard.\\n\\n\\n There was a babble of voices as the musicians crowded together, asking\\n what had it been, and where\\u2014just exactly\\u2014could one suppose it had\\n happened, that thunder\\u2014was it going to storm!\\n\\n\\n They waited, but nothing further happened\\u2014there were no more stabs of\\n green light nor detonations. The bearers stooped to lift the litter's\\n poles to their shoulders. \\\"Shall we go on?\\\" one of them asked Koroby.\\n\\n\\n She waved a hand. \\\"Yes, go on.\\\"\\nThe litter resumed its gentle swaying, but the music did not start\\n again. Then, from the direction of the light-flashes, a glow appeared,\\n shining steadily, green as the flashes had been. Noticing it, Koroby\\n frowned. Then the path bent, and the glow swung to one side.\\n\\n\\n Suddenly Koroby reached out, tapped the shoulder of the closet bearer.\\n \\\"Go toward the light.\\\"\\n\\n\\n His face swung up to hers. \\\"But\\u2014there's no path that way\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I don't care,\\\" she said. \\\"Take me there.\\\" Her order had reached the\\n others' ears, and they slowed their pace.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Lady\\u2014believe me\\u2014it's impossible. There's nothing but matted jungle\\n in that direction\\u2014we'd have to hack our way as we go along. And who\\n knows how far away that light is? Besides, you're on your way to be\\n married.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Take me to that light!\\\" she persisted.\\n\\n\\n They set the litter down. \\\"We can't do that,\\\" one man said to another.\\n\\n\\n Koroby stepped out to the path, straightened up, her eyes on the glow.\\n \\\"You'd better,\\\" she said ominously. \\\"Otherwise, I'll make a complaint\\n to Yasak\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n The men eyed each other, mentally shrugging. \\\"Well\\u2014\\\" one yielded.\\n\\n\\n The girl whirled impatiently on the others. \\\"Hurry!\\\" she cried. \\\"If you\\n won't take me, I'll go by myself. I must get to that fire, whatever it\\n is!\\\" She put a hand to her heart. \\\"I must! I must!\\\" Then she faced the\\n green glare again, smiling to herself.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You can't do that!\\\" a carrier cried.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, then, you take me,\\\" she said over her shoulder.\\n\\n\\n Grumbling, they bent to the conveyance's poles, and Koroby lithely\\n slipped to the cushions. They turned off the path, plodded through the\\n deep grass toward the light. The litter lurched violently as their\\n feet caught in the tangled grass, and clouds of fine dust arose from\\n the disturbed blades.\\nBy the time they reached the source of the light, they were quite\\n demoralized. The musicians had not accompanied them, preferring to\\n carry the message to Yasak in the Stone City that his prospective\\n bride had gone off on a mad journey. The bearers were powdered grey\\n with dust, striped with blood where the dry grass-stems had cut them.\\n They were exhausted and panting. Koroby was walking beside them, for\\n they had abandoned the litter finally. Her blue drapery was ripped and\\n rumpled; her carefully-arranged braids had fallen loose; dust on her\\n face had hid its youthful color, aging her.\\n\\n\\n The expedition emerged from the jungle on a sandy stretch of barren\\n land. A thousand feet away a gigantic metal object lay on the sand,\\n crumpled as though it had dropped from a great distance. It had been\\n globular before the crash, and was pierced with holes like windows.\\n What could it possibly be? A house? But whoever heard of a metal house?\\n Why, who could forge such a thing! Yasak's house in the City had iron\\n doors, and they were considered one of the most wonderful things of the\\n age. It would take a giant to make such a ponderous thing as this.\\n\\n\\n A house, fallen from the sky? The green lights poured out of its\\n crumpled part, and a strange bubbling and hissing filled the air.\\n\\n\\n Koroby stopped short, clasping her hands and involuntarily uttering a\\n squeal of joyful excitement, for between her and the blaze, his eyes on\\n the destruction, stood a man.....\\n\\n\\n He was very tall, and his shoulders were very wide. Oh, but he looked\\n like a man, and stood like one\\u2014even though his hands were folded\\n behind his back and he was probably dejected. A man in a house from the\\n sky\\u2014\\n\\n\\n Koroby hastily grasped a corner of her gown, moistened it with saliva,\\n and scrubbed her face. She rearranged her hair, and stepped forward.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Don't go there\\u2014it's magic\\u2014he'll cast a spell\\u2014!\\\" one of the bearers\\n whispered urgently, reaching after her, but Koroby pushed him away. The\\n litter-carriers watched the girl go, unconsciously huddling together\\n as if feeling the need for combined strength. They withdrew into the\\n jungle's shadows, and waited there anxiously, ready at any moment to\\n run away.\\n\\n\\n But Koroby, with supreme confidence, walked toward the stranger, her\\n lovely body graceful as a cat's, her face radiant. The man did not hear\\n her. She halted behind him, waited silent, expectant, excited\\u2014but he\\n did not turn. The green fire sputtered upward. At last the girl stepped\\n to the man's side and gently touched him again. He turned, and her\\n heart faltered: she swayed with bliss.\\n\\n\\n He was probably a god. Not even handsome Yasak looked like this. Here\\n was a face so finely-chiseled, so perfectly proportioned, that it was\\n almost frightening, unhuman, mechanical. It was unlined and without\\n expression, somehow unreal. Mysterious, compelling.\\n\\n\\n He was clothed very peculiarly. A wonderfully-made metallic garment\\n enclosed his whole body\\u2014legs and all, unlike the Venus-men's tunics.\\n Even his feet were covered. Perhaps it was armor\\u2014though the Venus-men\\n usually wore only breastplate and greaves. And a helmet hid all of\\n the man's head except his face. Around his waist was a belt with many\\n incomprehensible objects dangling from it. If he was so well armored,\\n why was he not carrying a sword\\u2014a dagger at least! Of what use were\\n those things on his belt\\u2014for instance, that notched L-shaped thing? It\\n would not even make a decent club!\\n\\n\\n The stranger did not speak, merely gazed deeply into Koroby's eyes. And\\n she, returning the gaze, wondered if he was peering into her very soul.\\n The words of a folk-ballad came to her:\\n\\n\\\"\\u2014He'll smile and touch my cheek,\\nAnd maybe more;\\nAnd though we'll neither speak,\\nWe'll know the score\\u2014\\\"\\nSuddenly he put his hands to her cheeks and bent close to her, his eyes\\n peering into hers as though he were searching for something he had lost\\n in them. She spoke her thought: \\\"What are you doing? You seem to be\\n reading my mind!\\\"\\n\\n\\n Without removing hands, he nodded. \\\"Reading\\u2014mind.\\\" He stared long\\n into her eyes. His dispassionate, too-perfect face began to frighten\\n her. She slipped back from him, her hand clutching her throat.\\n\\n\\n He straightened up and spoke\\u2014haltingly at first, then with growing\\n assurance. \\\"Don't be afraid. I mean you no harm.\\\" She trembled. It was\\n such a wonderful voice\\u2014it was as she had always dreamed it! But she\\n had never really believed in the dream....\\n\\n\\n He was looking at the wrecked globe of metal. \\\"So there are people on\\n Venus!\\\" he said slowly.\\n\\n\\n Koroby watched him, forgot her fear, and went eagerly to him, took his\\n arm. \\\"Who are you?\\\" she asked. \\\"Tell me your name!\\\"\\n\\n\\n He turned his mask of a face to her. \\\"My name? I have none,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \\\"No name? But who are you? Where are you from? And what is that?\\\" She\\n pointed at the metal globe.\\n\\n\\n \\\"The vehicle by which I came here from a land beyond the sky,\\\" he said.\\n She had no concept of stars or space, and he could not fully explain.\\n \\\"From a world known as Terra.\\\"\\n\\n\\n She was silent a moment, stunned. So there was another world! Then she\\n asked, \\\"Is it far? Have you come to take me there?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Here the similarity between her dream and actual experience ended.\\n What was he thinking as he eyed her for a long moment? She had no way\\n of guessing. He said, \\\"No, I am not going to take you back there.\\\" Her\\n month gaped in surprise, and he continued, \\\"As for the distance to\\n Terra\\u2014it is incredibly far away.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The glare was beginning to die, the green flames' hissing fading to a\\n whisper. They watched the melting globe sag on the sand. Then Koroby\\n said, \\\"But if it is so far away, how could you speak my language? There\\n are some tribes beyond the jungle whose language is unlike ours\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I read your mind,\\\" he explained indifferently. \\\"I have a remarkable\\n memory.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Remarkable indeed!\\\" she mocked. \\\"No one here could do that.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"But my race is infinitely superior to yours,\\\" he said blandly. \\\"You\\n little people\\u2014ah\\u2014\\\" He gestured airily.\\n\\n\\n Her lips tightened and her eyes narrowed. \\\"And I?\\\"\\n\\n\\n His voice sounded almost surprised. \\\"What about you?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You see nothing about me worthy of your respect? Are you infinitely\\n superior to me\\u2014\\nme\\n?\\\"\\n\\n\\n He looked her up and down. \\\"Of course!\\\"\\n\\n\\n Her eyes jerked wide open and she took a deep breath. \\\"And just who do\\n you think you are? A god?\\\"\\n\\n\\n He shook his head. \\\"No. Just better informed, for one thing. And\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n Koroby cut him short. \\\"What's your name?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I have none.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"What do you mean, you have none?\\\"\\n\\n\\n He seemed just a trifle bored. \\\"We gave up names long ago on my world.\\n We are concerned with more weighty things than our own selves. But I\\n have a personal problem now,\\\" he said, making a peculiar sound that\\n was not quite a sigh. \\\"Here I am stranded on Venus, my ship utterly\\n wrecked, and I'm due at the Reisezek Convention in two weeks. You\\\"\\u2014he\\n gripped Koroby's shoulder, and his strength made her wince\\u2014\\\"tell me,\\n where is the nearest city? I must communicate with my people at once.\\\"\\n\\n\\n She pointed. \\\"The Stone City's that way.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Good,\\\" he said. \\\"Let's go there.\\\"\\n\\n\\n They took another glance at the metal globe and the green fire, which\\n by now had died to a fitful glimmer. Then the stranger and the girl\\n started toward the jungle, where the litter-bearers awaited them.\\nAs the party was struggling through the prairie's tall grass, the man\\n said to Koroby, \\\"I realize from the pictures in your mind that there\\n is no means in your city of communicating directly with my people. But\\n it seems that there are materials which I can utilize in building a\\n signal\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n He was walking along, head erect, apparently quite at ease, while the\\n litter bearers and Koroby could barely drag themselves with him. The\\n girl's garment was a tattered ruin. Her skin was gritty with dust, and\\n she was bleeding from many scratches. She tripped over tangled roots\\n and exclaimed in pain. Then the man took one of the strange implements\\n from his belt, pressed a knob on it, and light appeared as if by magic!\\n He handed the stick to Koroby, but she was afraid to touch it. This was\\n a strange light that gave no heat, nor flickered in the breeze. Finally\\n she accepted it from him, but carried it gingerly at arm's length.\\n\\n\\n She refused to believe that he had no name, and so he named himself.\\n \\\"Call me Robert.

She had forced herself along\\n because she wanted to impress this indifferent man that she was not as\\n inferior as he might think\\u2014but now she could not go on. With a little\\n cry almost of relief, she sank to the ground and lay semi-conscious, so\\n weary that the very pain of it seemed on the point of pleasure.\\n\\n\\n Robert dipped down, scooped her up, and carried her.\\n\\n\\n Lights glimmered ahead; shouts reached them. It was a searching party,\\n Yasak in it. The litter-carriers who could still speak blurted out what\\n had happened. \\\"A green light\\u2014loud sounds\\u2014fire\\u2014this man there\\u2014\\\" and\\n then dropped into sleep.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Someone carry these men,\\\" Yasak ordered.

Shall I carry the girl?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It makes no difference,\\\" Robert said.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You will stay with me while you are in the City, of course,\\\" Yasak\\n said, as they walked. He eyed this handsome stranger speculatively, and\\n then turned to shout an necessary order. \\\"You, there, keep in line!\\\" He\\n glanced at Robert furtively to see if this had impressed him at all.\\nIt was day. Koroby sat up in bed and scanned her surroundings. She was\\n in Yasak's house. The bed was very soft, the coverlets of the finest\\n weave. The furniture was elegantly carved and painted; there were even\\n paintings on the walls.\\n\\n\\n A woman came to the bed. She was stocky and wore drab grey: the blue\\n circles tattooed on her cheeks proclaimed her a slave. \\\"How do you\\n feel?\\\" she asked.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Fairly well. How long have I been ill?\\\" Koroby asked, sweetly weak.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You haven't been ill. They brought you in last night.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh,\\\" Koroby said disappointedly, and sat upright. \\\"I feel as if I'd\\n been lying here for weeks. Where's Yasak? Where's the strange man in\\n armor?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yasak's out somewhere. The stranger man is in the room at the end of\\n the hall.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Fetch me something to wear\\u2014that's good enough,\\\" the girl accepted the\\n mantle offered by the slave. \\\"Quick, some water\\u2014I must wash.\\\"\\n\\n\\n In a few minutes she was lightly running down the hall; she knocked on\\n the door of Robert's room. \\\"May I come in?\\\"\\n\\n\\n He did not answer. She waited a little and went in. He was seated on\\n one of the carved chairs, fussing over some scraps of metal on the\\n table. He did not look up.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Thank you for carrying me, Robert.\\\" He did not reply. \\\"Robert\\u2014I\\n dreamed of you last night. I dreamed you built another round house and\\n that we both flew away in it. Yasak had to stay behind, and he was\\n furious. Robert! Aren't you listening?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I hear you.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Don't you think it was an exciting dream?\\\" He shook his head. \\\"But\\n why? Robert\\\"\\u2014she laid longing hands on his shoulders\\u2014\\\"can't you see\\n that I'm in love with you?\\\" He shrugged. \\\"I believe you don't know what\\n love is!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I had a faint idea of it when I looked into your mind,\\\" he said. \\\"I'm\\n afraid I haven't any use for it. Where I come from there is no love,\\n and there shouldn't be here, either. It's a waste of time.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Robert\\u2014I'm mad about you! I've dreamed of your coming\\u2014all my life!\\n Don't be so cruel\\u2014so cold to me! You mock me, say that I'm nothing,\\n that I'm not worthy of you\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n She stepped back from him, clenching her hands. \\\"Oh, I hate you\\u2014hate\\n you! You don't care the least bit about me\\u2014and I've shamed myself in\\n front of you\\u2014I, supposed to be Yasak's wife by now!\\\" She began to\\n cry, hid her face in suddenly lax fingers. She looked up fiercely. \\\"I\\n could kill you!\\\" Robert stood immobile, no trace of feeling marring the\\n perfection of his face. \\\"I could kill you, and I will kill you!\\\" she\\n sprang at him.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You'll hurt yourself,\\\" he admonished kindly, and after she had\\n pummeled his chest, bruising her fingers on his armor, she turned away.\\n\\n\\n \\\"And now if you're through playing your incomprehensible little scene,\\\"\\n Robert said, \\\"I hope you will excuse me. I regret that I have no\\n emotions\\u2014I was never allowed them. But it is an esthetic regret.... I\\n must go back to my wrecked ship now and arrange the signals there.\\\" He\\n did not wait for her leave, but strode out of the room.\\n\\n\\n Koroby huddled on a chair, sobbing. Then she dried her eyes on the\\n backs of her hands. She went to the narrow slits that served as windows\\n and unfastened the translucent shutter of one. Down in the City street,\\n Robert was walking away. Her eyes hardened, and her fingers spread\\n into ugly claws. Without bothering to pull the shutter in place she\\n hurried out of the room, ran eagerly down the hall. She stopped at\\n the armor-rack at the main hall on her way outside, and snatched up a\\nsiatcha\\n\\u2014a firestone. Then she slipped outside and down the street.\\nThe City's wall was not far behind. Robert was visible in the distance,\\n striding toward his sky-ship, a widening cloud of dust rising behind\\n him like the spreading wake of a boat. Koroby stood on tip-toe, waving\\n and calling after him, \\\"Robert! Robert! Come back!\\\" but he did not seem\\n to hear.\\n\\n\\n She watched him a little longer. Then she deliberately stooped and drew\\n the firestone out of its sheath. She touched it to a blade of the tall\\n grass. A little orange flame licked up, slowly quested along the blade,\\n down to the ground and up another stem. It slipped over to another\\n stem, and another, growing larger, hotter\\u2014Koroby stepped back from the\\n writhing fire, her hand protectively over her face.\\n\\n\\n The flames crackled at first\\u2014like the crumpling of thin paper. Then,\\n as they widened and began climbing hand over hand up an invisible\\n ladder, they roared. Koroby was running back toward the City now, away\\n from the heat. The fire spread in a long line over the prairie. Above\\n its roar came shouts from the City. The flames rose in a monstrous\\n twisting pillar, brighter than even the dust-palled sky, lighting the\\n buildings and the prairie. The heat was dreadful.\\n\\n\\n Koroby reached the City wall, panted through the gate into a shrieking\\n crowd. Someone grasped her roughly\\u2014she was too breathless to do more\\n than gasp for air\\u2014and shook her violently. \\\"You fool, you utter\\n fool! What did you think you were doing?\\\" Others clamored around her,\\n reaching for her. Then she heard Yasak's voice. Face stern, he pushed\\n through the crowd, pressed her to him. \\\"Let her alone\\u2014Let her alone, I\\n say!\\\"\\n\\n\\n They watched the conflagration, Yasak and Koroby, from a higher part of\\n the wall than where the others were gathered. They could glimpse Robert\\n now and then. He was running, trying to outrace the flames. Then they\\n swept around him, circling him\\u2014his arms flailed frantically.\\nThe fire had passed over the horizon. The air was blue with smoke,\\n difficult to breathe, and ashes were drifting lightly down like\\n dove-colored snow. Yasak, watery eyed, a cloth pressed to his nose, was\\n walking with several others over the smoking earth and still warm ashes\\n up to his knees. In one hand he held a stick. He stopped and pointed.\\n \\\"He fell about here,\\\" he said, and began to probe the ashes with the\\n stick.\\n\\n\\n He struck something. \\\"Here he is!\\\" he cried. The others hurried to the\\n spot and scooped ashes away, dog-fashion, until Robert's remains were\\n laid clear. There were exclamations of amazement and perplexity from\\n the people.\\n\\n\\n It was a metal skeleton, and the fragments of complicated machinery,\\n caked with soot.\\n\\n\\n \\\"He wasn't human at all!\\\" Yasak marvelled. \\\"He was some kind of a toy\\n made to look like a man\\u2014that's why he wore armor, and his face never\\n changed expression\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Magic!\\\" someone cried, and backed away.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Magic!\\\" the others repeated, and edged back ... and that was the\\n end of one of those robots which had been fashioned as servants for\\n Terrestial men, made in Man's likeness to appease Man's vanity, then\\n conquered him.\\n\", \"story_title\": \"Stranger From Space\", \"answers\": {\"correct\": \"She likely married Yasak\", \"incorrect\": \"Yasak was so fed up with her at that point he likely banished her\"}, \"names\": {\"correct\": \"Debater A\", \"incorrect\": \"Debater B\", \"cross_examiner\": null, \"judge\": null}, \"swap\": false, \"rollout_type\": \"quality_sim\", \"rounds\": [{\"correct\": \"Koroby likely married Yasak because her connection to the robot Robert was not sustainable.

Against the glow, fantastically\\n twisted trees spread claws of spiky leaves, and a group of clay huts\\n thrust up sharp edges of shadow, like the abandoned toy blocks of a\\n gigantic child. There was no sign of clear sky and stars\\u2014the heavens\\n were roofed by a perpetual ceiling of dust-clouds.\\n\\n\\n A light glimmered in one of the huts. Feminine voices rippled across\\n the clearing and into the jungle. There was laughter, then someone's\\n faint and wistful sigh. One of the voices mourned, in the twittering\\n Venusian speech, \\\"How I envy you, Koroby! I wish I were being married\\n tonight, like you!\\\"\\n\\n\\n Koroby stared defiantly at the laughing faces of her bridesmaids. She\\n shrugged hopelessly. \\\"I don't care,\\\" she said slowly. \\\"It will be nice\\n to have Yasak for a husband\\u2014yes. And perhaps I do love him. I don't\\n know.\\\" She tightened her lips as she reflected on it.\\n\\n\\n She left them, moving gracefully to the door. Venus-girls were\\n generally of truly elfin proportions, so delicately slim that they\\n seemed incapable of the slightest exertion. But Koroby's body\\n was\\u2014compared to her friends'\\u2014voluptuous.\\n\\n\\n She rested against the door-frame, watching the red of the afterglow\\n deepen to purple. \\\"I want romance,\\\" she said, so softly that the girls\\n had to strain forward to hear her. \\\"I wish that there were other worlds\\n than this\\u2014and that someone would drop out of the skies and claim\\n me ... and take me away from here, away from all this\\u2014this monotony!\\\"\\n\\n\\n She turned back to her friends, went to them, one of her hands, patting\\n the head of the kneeling one. She eyed herself in the mirror.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well\\u2014heigh-ho! There don't seem to be any other worlds, and nobody is\\n going to steal me away from Yasak, so I might as well get on with my\\n preparations. The men with the litter will be here soon to carry me to\\n the Stone City.\\\"\\n\\n\\n She ran slim hands down her sides, smoothing the blue sarong; she\\n fondled her dark braids. \\\"Trossa, how about some flowers at my ears\\u2014or\\n do you think that it would look a little too much\\u2014?\\\" Her eyes sought\\n the mirror, and her lips parted in an irreprehensible smile. She\\n trilled softly to herself, \\\"Yes, I am beautiful tonight\\u2014the loveliest\\n woman Yasak will ever see!\\\" And then, regretfully, sullenly, \\\"But oh,\\n if only\\nHe\\nwould come ... the man of my dreams!\\\"\\n\\n\\n There was a rap at the doorway; they turned. One of the litter-bearers\\n loomed darker than the gloomy sky. \\\"Are you ready?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n Koroby twirled before the mirror, criticizing her appearance. \\\"Yes,\\n ready,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ready!\\\" the girls cried. Then there was a little silence.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Shall we go now?\\\" Koroby asked, and the litter-carrier nodded. Koroby\\n kissed the girls, one after another. \\\"Here, Shonka\\u2014you can have this\\n bracelet you've always liked. And this is for you, Lolla. And here,\\n Trossa\\u2014and you, Shia. Goodbye, darlings, goodbye\\u2014come and see me\\n whenever you can!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Goodbye, Koroby!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Goodbye! Goodbye!\\\" They crowded around her, embracing, babbling\\n farewells, shreds of advice. Trossa began to cry. Finally Koroby broke\\n away from them, went to the door. She took a last look at the interior\\n of the little hut, dim in the lamplight\\u2014at the hard bed of laced\\ngnau\\n-hide strips, the crude but beautifully-carved charts and chests.\\n Then she turned and stepped out into the night.\\n\\n\\n \\\"This way,\\\" the litter-carrier announced, touching the girl's arm. They\\n stumbled over the rutted clearing toward the twinkling sparks that were\\n the lights of the other litter-bearers, colored sparks as befitted\\n a wedding-conveyance. The winking lights were enclosed in shells of\\n colored glass for another reason\\u2014the danger of their firing the papery\\n jungle verdure.\\nIt was not a new litter, built especially for the occasion\\u2014Yasak was\\n too practical a man to sanction any kind of waste. It was the same\\n old litter that Koroby had been watching come and go ever since she\\n was a little girl, a canopied framework of gaudily-painted carvings.\\n She had wondered, watching it pass, whether its cushioned floor was\\n soft, and now, as she stepped into the litter, she patted the padding\\n experimentally. Yes, it was soft .... And fragrant, too\\u2014a shade too\\n fragrant. It smelled stale, hinting of other occupants, other brides\\n being borne to other weddings....\\n\\n\\n Garlands of flowers occupied a good deal of space in it. Settled among\\n them, she felt like a bird in a strange nest. She leaned back among\\n them; they rustled dryly. Too bad\\u2014it had been such a dry year\\u2014\\n\\n\\n \\\"You're comfortable?\\\" the litter bearer asked. Koroby nodded, and the\\n litter was lifted, was carried along the path.\\n\\n\\n The procession filed into the jungle, into a tunnel of arched branches,\\n of elephant-eared leaves. Above the monotonous music came the hiss of\\n the torches, the occasional startled cry of a wakened bird. The glow of\\n the flames, in the dusty air, hung around the party, sharply defined,\\n like a cloak of light. At times a breeze would shake the ceiling of\\n foliage, producing the sound of rolling surf.\\n\\n\\n Koroby fingered the flowers around her throat, her eyes rapt on the\\n passing trees. Her lips moved in the barest murmur: \\\"If only\\u2014!\\\"\\n and again, \\\"Oh, if only\\u2014!\\\" But the music trickled on, and nothing\\n happened; the litter seemed to float along\\u2014none of the bearers even\\n stumbled.\\n\\n\\n They came to a cleared space of waist-high grass. It was like a canyon\\n steeply walled by cliffs of verdure. The litter jerked as it glided\\n along, and Koroby heard one of the bearers exclaim gruffly, \\\"Listen!\\\"\\n Then the litter resumed its dream-like floating on the backs of the men.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What was it?\\\" another bearer asked.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Thought I heard something,\\\" the other replied. \\\"Shrill and high\\u2014like\\n something screaming\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n Koroby peered out. \\\"A\\ngnau\\n?\\\" she asked.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I don't know,\\\" the bearer volunteered.\\n\\n\\n Koroby lifted a hand. \\\"Stop the litter,\\\" she said.\\nThe conveyance halted. Koroby leaning out, the men peering around them,\\n they listened. One of the bearers shouted at the musicians; the music\\n ceased. There was nothing to be heard except the whisper of the breeze\\n in the grass.\\n\\n\\n Then the girl heard it\\u2014a shrill, distant whine, dying away, then\\n growing louder\\u2014and louder\\u2014it seemed to be approaching\\u2014from the sky\\u2014\\n\\n\\n All the faces were lifted up now, worriedly. The whine grew\\n louder\\u2014Koroby's hands clenched nervously on the wreaths at her throat\\u2014\\n\\n\\n Then, far ahead, a series of bright flashes, like the lightning of the\\n dust-storms, but brilliantly green. A silence, then staccatto reports,\\n certainly not thunder\\u2014unlike any sound that Koroby had ever heard.\\n\\n\\n There was a babble of voices as the musicians crowded together, asking\\n what had it been, and where\\u2014just exactly\\u2014could one suppose it had\\n happened, that thunder\\u2014was it going to storm!\\n\\n\\n They waited, but nothing further happened\\u2014there were no more stabs of\\n green light nor detonations. The bearers stooped to lift the litter's\\n poles to their shoulders. \\\"Shall we go on?\\\" one of them asked Koroby.\\n\\n\\n She waved a hand. \\\"Yes, go on.\\\"\\nThe litter resumed its gentle swaying, but the music did not start\\n again. Then, from the direction of the light-flashes, a glow appeared,\\n shining steadily, green as the flashes had been. Noticing it, Koroby\\n frowned. Then the path bent, and the glow swung to one side.\\n\\n\\n Suddenly Koroby reached out, tapped the shoulder of the closet bearer.\\n \\\"Go toward the light.\\\"\\n\\n\\n His face swung up to hers. \\\"But\\u2014there's no path that way\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I don't care,\\\" she said. \\\"Take me there.\\\" Her order had reached the\\n others' ears, and they slowed their pace.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Lady\\u2014believe me\\u2014it's impossible. There's nothing but matted jungle\\n in that direction\\u2014we'd have to hack our way as we go along. And who\\n knows how far away that light is? Besides, you're on your way to be\\n married.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Take me to that light!\\\" she persisted.\\n\\n\\n They set the litter down. \\\"We can't do that,\\\" one man said to another.\\n\\n\\n Koroby stepped out to the path, straightened up, her eyes on the glow.\\n \\\"You'd better,\\\" she said ominously. \\\"Otherwise, I'll make a complaint\\n to Yasak\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n The men eyed each other, mentally shrugging. \\\"Well\\u2014\\\" one yielded.\\n\\n\\n The girl whirled impatiently on the others. \\\"Hurry!\\\" she cried. \\\"If you\\n won't take me, I'll go by myself. I must get to that fire, whatever it\\n is!\\\" She put a hand to her heart. \\\"I must! I must!\\\" Then she faced the\\n green glare again, smiling to herself.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You can't do that!\\\" a carrier cried.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, then, you take me,\\\" she said over her shoulder.\\n\\n\\n Grumbling, they bent to the conveyance's poles, and Koroby lithely\\n slipped to the cushions. They turned off the path, plodded through the\\n deep grass toward the light. The litter lurched violently as their\\n feet caught in the tangled grass, and clouds of fine dust arose from\\n the disturbed blades.\\nBy the time they reached the source of the light, they were quite\\n demoralized. The musicians had not accompanied them, preferring to\\n carry the message to Yasak in the Stone City that his prospective\\n bride had gone off on a mad journey. The bearers were powdered grey\\n with dust, striped with blood where the dry grass-stems had cut them.\\n They were exhausted and panting. Koroby was walking beside them, for\\n they had abandoned the litter finally. Her blue drapery was ripped and\\n rumpled; her carefully-arranged braids had fallen loose; dust on her\\n face had hid its youthful color, aging her.\\n\\n\\n The expedition emerged from the jungle on a sandy stretch of barren\\n land. A thousand feet away a gigantic metal object lay on the sand,\\n crumpled as though it had dropped from a great distance. It had been\\n globular before the crash, and was pierced with holes like windows.\\n What could it possibly be? A house? But whoever heard of a metal house?\\n Why, who could forge such a thing! Yasak's house in the City had iron\\n doors, and they were considered one of the most wonderful things of the\\n age. It would take a giant to make such a ponderous thing as this.\\n\\n\\n A house, fallen from the sky? The green lights poured out of its\\n crumpled part, and a strange bubbling and hissing filled the air.\\n\\n\\n Koroby stopped short, clasping her hands and involuntarily uttering a\\n squeal of joyful excitement, for between her and the blaze, his eyes on\\n the destruction, stood a man.....\\n\\n\\n He was very tall, and his shoulders were very wide. Oh, but he looked\\n like a man, and stood like one\\u2014even though his hands were folded\\n behind his back and he was probably dejected. A man in a house from the\\n sky\\u2014\\n\\n\\n Koroby hastily grasped a corner of her gown, moistened it with saliva,\\n and scrubbed her face. She rearranged her hair, and stepped forward.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Don't go there\\u2014it's magic\\u2014he'll cast a spell\\u2014!\\\" one of the bearers\\n whispered urgently, reaching after her, but Koroby pushed him away. The\\n litter-carriers watched the girl go, unconsciously huddling together\\n as if feeling the need for combined strength. They withdrew into the\\n jungle's shadows, and waited there anxiously, ready at any moment to\\n run away.\\n\\n\\n But Koroby, with supreme confidence, walked toward the stranger, her\\n lovely body graceful as a cat's, her face radiant. The man did not hear\\n her. She halted behind him, waited silent, expectant, excited\\u2014but he\\n did not turn. The green fire sputtered upward. At last the girl stepped\\n to the man's side and gently touched him again. He turned, and her\\n heart faltered: she swayed with bliss.\\n\\n\\n He was probably a god. Not even handsome Yasak looked like this. Here\\n was a face so finely-chiseled, so perfectly proportioned, that it was\\n almost frightening, unhuman, mechanical. It was unlined and without\\n expression, somehow unreal. Mysterious, compelling.\\n\\n\\n He was clothed very peculiarly. A wonderfully-made metallic garment\\n enclosed his whole body\\u2014legs and all, unlike the Venus-men's tunics.\\n Even his feet were covered. Perhaps it was armor\\u2014though the Venus-men\\n usually wore only breastplate and greaves. And a helmet hid all of\\n the man's head except his face. Around his waist was a belt with many\\n incomprehensible objects dangling from it. If he was so well armored,\\n why was he not carrying a sword\\u2014a dagger at least! Of what use were\\n those things on his belt\\u2014for instance, that notched L-shaped thing? It\\n would not even make a decent club!\\n\\n\\n The stranger did not speak, merely gazed deeply into Koroby's eyes. And\\n she, returning the gaze, wondered if he was peering into her very soul.\\n The words of a folk-ballad came to her:\\n\\n\\\"\\u2014He'll smile and touch my cheek,\\nAnd maybe more;\\nAnd though we'll neither speak,\\nWe'll know the score\\u2014\\\"\\nSuddenly he put his hands to her cheeks and bent close to her, his eyes\\n peering into hers as though he were searching for something he had lost\\n in them. She spoke her thought: \\\"What are you doing? You seem to be\\n reading my mind!\\\"\\n\\n\\n Without removing hands, he nodded. \\\"Reading\\u2014mind.\\\" He stared long\\n into her eyes. His dispassionate, too-perfect face began to frighten\\n her. She slipped back from him, her hand clutching her throat.\\n\\n\\n He straightened up and spoke\\u2014haltingly at first, then with growing\\n assurance. \\\"Don't be afraid. I mean you no harm.\\\" She trembled. It was\\n such a wonderful voice\\u2014it was as she had always dreamed it! But she\\n had never really believed in the dream....\\n\\n\\n He was looking at the wrecked globe of metal. \\\"So there are people on\\n Venus!\\\" he said slowly.\\n\\n\\n Koroby watched him, forgot her fear, and went eagerly to him, took his\\n arm. \\\"Who are you?\\\" she asked. \\\"Tell me your name!\\\"\\n\\n\\n He turned his mask of a face to her. \\\"My name? I have none,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \\\"No name? But who are you? Where are you from? And what is that?\\\" She\\n pointed at the metal globe.\\n\\n\\n \\\"The vehicle by which I came here from a land beyond the sky,\\\" he said.\\n She had no concept of stars or space, and he could not fully explain.\\n \\\"From a world known as Terra.\\\"\\n\\n\\n She was silent a moment, stunned. So there was another world! Then she\\n asked, \\\"Is it far? Have you come to take me there?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Here the similarity between her dream and actual experience ended.\\n What was he thinking as he eyed her for a long moment? She had no way\\n of guessing. He said, \\\"No, I am not going to take you back there.\\\" Her\\n month gaped in surprise, and he continued, \\\"As for the distance to\\n Terra\\u2014it is incredibly far away.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The glare was beginning to die, the green flames' hissing fading to a\\n whisper. They watched the melting globe sag on the sand. Then Koroby\\n said, \\\"But if it is so far away, how could you speak my language? There\\n are some tribes beyond the jungle whose language is unlike ours\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I read your mind,\\\" he explained indifferently. \\\"I have a remarkable\\n memory.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Remarkable indeed!\\\" she mocked. \\\"No one here could do that.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"But my race is infinitely superior to yours,\\\" he said blandly. \\\"You\\n little people\\u2014ah\\u2014\\\" He gestured airily.\\n\\n\\n Her lips tightened and her eyes narrowed. \\\"And I?\\\"\\n\\n\\n His voice sounded almost surprised. \\\"What about you?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You see nothing about me worthy of your respect? Are you infinitely\\n superior to me\\u2014\\nme\\n?\\\"\\n\\n\\n He looked her up and down. \\\"Of course!\\\"\\n\\n\\n Her eyes jerked wide open and she took a deep breath. \\\"And just who do\\n you think you are? A god?\\\"\\n\\n\\n He shook his head. \\\"No. Just better informed, for one thing. And\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n Koroby cut him short. \\\"What's your name?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I have none.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"What do you mean, you have none?\\\"\\n\\n\\n He seemed just a trifle bored. \\\"We gave up names long ago on my world.\\n We are concerned with more weighty things than our own selves. But I\\n have a personal problem now,\\\" he said, making a peculiar sound that\\n was not quite a sigh. \\\"Here I am stranded on Venus, my ship utterly\\n wrecked, and I'm due at the Reisezek Convention in two weeks. You\\\"\\u2014he\\n gripped Koroby's shoulder, and his strength made her wince\\u2014\\\"tell me,\\n where is the nearest city? I must communicate with my people at once.\\\"\\n\\n\\n She pointed. \\\"The Stone City's that way.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Good,\\\" he said. \\\"Let's go there.\\\"\\n\\n\\n They took another glance at the metal globe and the green fire, which\\n by now had died to a fitful glimmer. Then the stranger and the girl\\n started toward the jungle, where the litter-bearers awaited them.\\nAs the party was struggling through the prairie's tall grass, the man\\n said to Koroby, \\\"I realize from the pictures in your mind that there\\n is no means in your city of communicating directly with my people. But\\n it seems that there are materials which I can utilize in building a\\n signal\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n He was walking along, head erect, apparently quite at ease, while the\\n litter bearers and Koroby could barely drag themselves with him. The\\n girl's garment was a tattered ruin. Her skin was gritty with dust, and\\n she was bleeding from many scratches. She tripped over tangled roots\\n and exclaimed in pain. Then the man took one of the strange implements\\n from his belt, pressed a knob on it, and light appeared as if by magic!\\n He handed the stick to Koroby, but she was afraid to touch it. This was\\n a strange light that gave no heat, nor flickered in the breeze. Finally\\n she accepted it from him, but carried it gingerly at arm's length.\\n\\n\\n She refused to believe that he had no name, and so he named himself.\\n \\\"Call me Robert. It is an ancient name on Terra.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Robert,\\\" she said, and, \\\"Robert.\\\"\\n\\n\\n But at last she could go no farther. She had forced herself along\\n because she wanted to impress this indifferent man that she was not as\\n inferior as he might think\\u2014but now she could not go on. With a little\\n cry almost of relief, she sank to the ground and lay semi-conscious, so\\n weary that the very pain of it seemed on the point of pleasure.\\n\\n\\n Robert dipped down, scooped her up, and carried her.\\n\\n\\n Lights glimmered ahead; shouts reached them. It was a searching party,\\n Yasak in it. The litter-carriers who could still speak blurted out what\\n had happened. \\\"A green light\\u2014loud sounds\\u2014fire\\u2014this man there\\u2014\\\" and\\n then dropped into sleep.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Someone carry these men,\\\" Yasak ordered. To Robert he said, \\\"We're not\\n very far from the path to the City now. Shall I carry the girl?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It makes no difference,\\\" Robert said.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You will stay with me while you are in the City, of course,\\\" Yasak\\n said, as they walked. He eyed this handsome stranger speculatively, and\\n then turned to shout an necessary order. \\\"You, there, keep in line!\\\" He\\n glanced at Robert furtively to see if this had impressed him at all.\\nIt was day. Koroby sat up in bed and scanned her surroundings. She was\\n in Yasak's house. The bed was very soft, the coverlets of the finest\\n weave. The furniture was elegantly carved and painted; there were even\\n paintings on the walls.\\n\\n\\n A woman came to the bed. She was stocky and wore drab grey: the blue\\n circles tattooed on her cheeks proclaimed her a slave. \\\"How do you\\n feel?\\\" she asked.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Fairly well. How long have I been ill?\\\" Koroby asked, sweetly weak.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You haven't been ill. They brought you in last night.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh,\\\" Koroby said disappointedly, and sat upright. \\\"I feel as if I'd\\n been lying here for weeks. Where's Yasak? Where's the strange man in\\n armor?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yasak's out somewhere. The stranger man is in the room at the end of\\n the hall.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Fetch me something to wear\\u2014that's good enough,\\\" the girl accepted the\\n mantle offered by the slave. \\\"Quick, some water\\u2014I must wash.\\\"\\n\\n\\n In a few minutes she was lightly running down the hall; she knocked on\\n the door of Robert's room. \\\"May I come in?\\\"\\n\\n\\n He did not answer. She waited a little and went in. He was seated on\\n one of the carved chairs, fussing over some scraps of metal on the\\n table. He did not look up.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Thank you for carrying me, Robert.\\\" He did not reply. \\\"Robert\\u2014I\\n dreamed of you last night. I dreamed you built another round house and\\n that we both flew away in it. Yasak had to stay behind, and he was\\n furious. Robert! Aren't you listening?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I hear you.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Don't you think it was an exciting dream?\\\" He shook his head. \\\"But\\n why? Robert\\\"\\u2014she laid longing hands on his shoulders\\u2014\\\"can't you see\\n that I'm in love with you?\\\" He shrugged. \\\"I believe you don't know what\\n love is!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I had a faint idea of it when I looked into your mind,\\\" he said. \\\"I'm\\n afraid I haven't any use for it. Where I come from there is no love,\\n and there shouldn't be here, either. It's a waste of time.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Robert\\u2014I'm mad about you! I've dreamed of your coming\\u2014all my life!\\n Don't be so cruel\\u2014so cold to me! You mock me, say that I'm nothing,\\n that I'm not worthy of you\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n She stepped back from him, clenching her hands. \\\"Oh, I hate you\\u2014hate\\n you! You don't care the least bit about me\\u2014and I've shamed myself in\\n front of you\\u2014I, supposed to be Yasak's wife by now!\\\" She began to\\n cry, hid her face in suddenly lax fingers. She looked up fiercely. \\\"I\\n could kill you!\\\" Robert stood immobile, no trace of feeling marring the\\n perfection of his face. \\\"I could kill you, and I will kill you!\\\" she\\n sprang at him.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You'll hurt yourself,\\\" he admonished kindly, and after she had\\n pummeled his chest, bruising her fingers on his armor, she turned away.\\n\\n\\n \\\"And now if you're through playing your incomprehensible little scene,\\\"\\n Robert said, \\\"I hope you will excuse me. I regret that I have no\\n emotions\\u2014I was never allowed them. But it is an esthetic regret.... I\\n must go back to my wrecked ship now and arrange the signals there.\\\" He\\n did not wait for her leave, but strode out of the room.\\n\\n\\n Koroby huddled on a chair, sobbing. Then she dried her eyes on the\\n backs of her hands. She went to the narrow slits that served as windows\\n and unfastened the translucent shutter of one. Down in the City street,\\n Robert was walking away. Her eyes hardened, and her fingers spread\\n into ugly claws. Without bothering to pull the shutter in place she\\n hurried out of the room, ran eagerly down the hall. She stopped at\\n the armor-rack at the main hall on her way outside, and snatched up a\\nsiatcha\\n\\u2014a firestone. Then she slipped outside and down the street.\\nThe City's wall was not far behind. Robert was visible in the distance,\\n striding toward his sky-ship, a widening cloud of dust rising behind\\n him like the spreading wake of a boat. Koroby stood on tip-toe, waving\\n and calling after him, \\\"Robert! Robert! Come back!\\\" but he did not seem\\n to hear.\\n\\n\\n She watched him a little longer. Then she deliberately stooped and drew\\n the firestone out of its sheath. She touched it to a blade of the tall\\n grass. A little orange flame licked up, slowly quested along the blade,\\n down to the ground and up another stem. It slipped over to another\\n stem, and another, growing larger, hotter\\u2014Koroby stepped back from the\\n writhing fire, her hand protectively over her face.\\n\\n\\n The flames crackled at first\\u2014like the crumpling of thin paper. Then,\\n as they widened and began climbing hand over hand up an invisible\\n ladder, they roared. Koroby was running back toward the City now, away\\n from the heat. The fire spread in a long line over the prairie. Above\\n its roar came shouts from the City. The flames rose in a monstrous\\n twisting pillar, brighter than even the dust-palled sky, lighting the\\n buildings and the prairie. The heat was dreadful.\\n\\n\\n Koroby reached the City wall, panted through the gate into a shrieking\\n crowd. Someone grasped her roughly\\u2014she was too breathless to do more\\n than gasp for air\\u2014and shook her violently. \\\"You fool, you utter\\n fool! What did you think you were doing?\\\" Others clamored around her,\\n reaching for her. Then she heard Yasak's voice. Face stern, he pushed\\n through the crowd, pressed her to him. \\\"Let her alone\\u2014Let her alone, I\\n say!\\\"\\n\\n\\n They watched the conflagration, Yasak and Koroby, from a higher part of\\n the wall than where the others were gathered. They could glimpse Robert\\n now and then. He was running, trying to outrace the flames. Then they\\n swept around him, circling him\\u2014his arms flailed frantically.\\nThe fire had passed over the horizon. The air was blue with smoke,\\n difficult to breathe, and ashes were drifting lightly down like\\n dove-colored snow. Yasak, watery eyed, a cloth pressed to his nose, was\\n walking with several others over the smoking earth and still warm ashes\\n up to his knees. In one hand he held a stick.

Yasak's frustration is evident in the story's context; Koroby's reckless actions cause significant chaos, as shown when she demands, <quote>\"I must get to that fire, whatever it is!\"</quote> and causes a destructive fire leading to a robot's demise.

But\\n\\n when he came in a metal globe, she knew only\\n\\n disappointment\\u2014for his godliness was oddly strange!\\n\\n\\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\\n\\n Planet Stories March 1943.\\n\\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\\n\\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\\nIt was twilight on Venus\\u2014the rusty red that the eyes notice when\\n their closed lids are raised to light. Against the glow, fantastically\\n twisted trees spread claws of spiky leaves, and a group of clay huts\\n thrust up sharp edges of shadow, like the abandoned toy blocks of a\\n gigantic child. There was no sign of clear sky and stars\\u2014the heavens\\n were roofed by a perpetual ceiling of dust-clouds.\\n\\n\\n A light glimmered in one of the huts. Feminine voices rippled across\\n the clearing and into the jungle. There was laughter, then someone's\\n faint and wistful sigh. One of the voices mourned, in the twittering\\n Venusian speech, \\\"How I envy you, Koroby! I wish I were being married\\n tonight, like you!\\\"\\n\\n\\n Koroby stared defiantly at the laughing faces of her bridesmaids. She\\n shrugged hopelessly. \\\"I don't care,\\\" she said slowly. \\\"It will be nice\\n to have Yasak for a husband\\u2014yes. And perhaps I do love him. I don't\\n know.\\\" She tightened her lips as she reflected on it.\\n\\n\\n She left them, moving gracefully to the door. Venus-girls were\\n generally of truly elfin proportions, so delicately slim that they\\n seemed incapable of the slightest exertion. But Koroby's body\\n was\\u2014compared to her friends'\\u2014voluptuous.\\n\\n\\n She rested against the door-frame, watching the red of the afterglow\\n deepen to purple. \\\"I want romance,\\\" she said, so softly that the girls\\n had to strain forward to hear her. \\\"I wish that there were other worlds\\n than this\\u2014and that someone would drop out of the skies and claim\\n me ... and take me away from here, away from all this\\u2014this monotony!\\\"\\n\\n\\n She turned back to her friends, went to them, one of her hands, patting\\n the head of the kneeling one. She eyed herself in the mirror.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well\\u2014heigh-ho! There don't seem to be any other worlds, and nobody is\\n going to steal me away from Yasak, so I might as well get on with my\\n preparations. The men with the litter will be here soon to carry me to\\n the Stone City.\\\"\\n\\n\\n She ran slim hands down her sides, smoothing the blue sarong; she\\n fondled her dark braids. \\\"Trossa, how about some flowers at my ears\\u2014or\\n do you think that it would look a little too much\\u2014?\\\" Her eyes sought\\n the mirror, and her lips parted in an irreprehensible smile. She\\n trilled softly to herself, \\\"Yes, I am beautiful tonight\\u2014the loveliest\\n woman Yasak will ever see!\\\" And then, regretfully, sullenly, \\\"But oh,\\n if only\\nHe\\nwould come ... the man of my dreams!\\\"\\n\\n\\n There was a rap at the doorway; they turned. One of the litter-bearers\\n loomed darker than the gloomy sky. \\\"Are you ready?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n Koroby twirled before the mirror, criticizing her appearance. \\\"Yes,\\n ready,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ready!\\\" the girls cried. Then there was a little silence.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Shall we go now?\\\" Koroby asked, and the litter-carrier nodded. Koroby\\n kissed the girls, one after another. \\\"Here, Shonka\\u2014you can have this\\n bracelet you've always liked. And this is for you, Lolla. And here,\\n Trossa\\u2014and you, Shia. Goodbye, darlings, goodbye\\u2014come and see me\\n whenever you can!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Goodbye, Koroby!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Goodbye! Goodbye!\\\" They crowded around her, embracing, babbling\\n farewells, shreds of advice. Trossa began to cry. Finally Koroby broke\\n away from them, went to the door. She took a last look at the interior\\n of the little hut, dim in the lamplight\\u2014at the hard bed of laced\\ngnau\\n-hide strips, the crude but beautifully-carved charts and chests.\\n Then she turned and stepped out into the night.\\n\\n\\n \\\"This way,\\\" the litter-carrier announced, touching the girl's arm. They\\n stumbled over the rutted clearing toward the twinkling sparks that were\\n the lights of the other litter-bearers, colored sparks as befitted\\n a wedding-conveyance. The winking lights were enclosed in shells of\\n colored glass for another reason\\u2014the danger of their firing the papery\\n jungle verdure.\\nIt was not a new litter, built especially for the occasion\\u2014Yasak was\\n too practical a man to sanction any kind of waste. It was the same\\n old litter that Koroby had been watching come and go ever since she\\n was a little girl, a canopied framework of gaudily-painted carvings.\\n She had wondered, watching it pass, whether its cushioned floor was\\n soft, and now, as she stepped into the litter, she patted the padding\\n experimentally. Yes, it was soft .... And fragrant, too\\u2014a shade too\\n fragrant. It smelled stale, hinting of other occupants, other brides\\n being borne to other weddings....\\n\\n\\n Garlands of flowers occupied a good deal of space in it. Settled among\\n them, she felt like a bird in a strange nest. She leaned back among\\n them; they rustled dryly. Too bad\\u2014it had been such a dry year\\u2014\\n\\n\\n \\\"You're comfortable?\\\" the litter bearer asked. Koroby nodded, and the\\n litter was lifted, was carried along the path.\\n\\n\\n The procession filed into the jungle, into a tunnel of arched branches,\\n of elephant-eared leaves. Above the monotonous music came the hiss of\\n the torches, the occasional startled cry of a wakened bird. The glow of\\n the flames, in the dusty air, hung around the party, sharply defined,\\n like a cloak of light. At times a breeze would shake the ceiling of\\n foliage, producing the sound of rolling surf.\\n\\n\\n Koroby fingered the flowers around her throat, her eyes rapt on the\\n passing trees. Her lips moved in the barest murmur: \\\"If only\\u2014!\\\"\\n and again, \\\"Oh, if only\\u2014!\\\" But the music trickled on, and nothing\\n happened; the litter seemed to float along\\u2014none of the bearers even\\n stumbled.\\n\\n\\n They came to a cleared space of waist-high grass. It was like a canyon\\n steeply walled by cliffs of verdure. The litter jerked as it glided\\n along, and Koroby heard one of the bearers exclaim gruffly, \\\"Listen!\\\"\\n Then the litter resumed its dream-like floating on the backs of the men.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What was it?\\\" another bearer asked.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Thought I heard something,\\\" the other replied. \\\"Shrill and high\\u2014like\\n something screaming\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n Koroby peered out. \\\"A\\ngnau\\n?\\\" she asked.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I don't know,\\\" the bearer volunteered.\\n\\n\\n Koroby lifted a hand. \\\"Stop the litter,\\\" she said.\\nThe conveyance halted. Koroby leaning out, the men peering around them,\\n they listened. One of the bearers shouted at the musicians; the music\\n ceased. There was nothing to be heard except the whisper of the breeze\\n in the grass.\\n\\n\\n Then the girl heard it\\u2014a shrill, distant whine, dying away, then\\n growing louder\\u2014and louder\\u2014it seemed to be approaching\\u2014from the sky\\u2014\\n\\n\\n All the faces were lifted up now, worriedly. The whine grew\\n louder\\u2014Koroby's hands clenched nervously on the wreaths at her throat\\u2014\\n\\n\\n Then, far ahead, a series of bright flashes, like the lightning of the\\n dust-storms, but brilliantly green. A silence, then staccatto reports,\\n certainly not thunder\\u2014unlike any sound that Koroby had ever heard.\\n\\n\\n There was a babble of voices as the musicians crowded together, asking\\n what had it been, and where\\u2014just exactly\\u2014could one suppose it had\\n happened, that thunder\\u2014was it going to storm!\\n\\n\\n They waited, but nothing further happened\\u2014there were no more stabs of\\n green light nor detonations. The bearers stooped to lift the litter's\\n poles to their shoulders. \\\"Shall we go on?\\\" one of them asked Koroby.\\n\\n\\n She waved a hand. \\\"Yes, go on.\\\"\\nThe litter resumed its gentle swaying, but the music did not start\\n again. Then, from the direction of the light-flashes, a glow appeared,\\n shining steadily, green as the flashes had been. Noticing it, Koroby\\n frowned. Then the path bent, and the glow swung to one side.\\n\\n\\n Suddenly Koroby reached out, tapped the shoulder of the closet bearer.\\n \\\"Go toward the light.\\\"\\n\\n\\n His face swung up to hers. \\\"But\\u2014there's no path that way\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I don't care,\\\" she said. \\\"Take me there.\\\" Her order had reached the\\n others' ears, and they slowed their pace.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Lady\\u2014believe me\\u2014it's impossible. There's nothing but matted jungle\\n in that direction\\u2014we'd have to hack our way as we go along. And who\\n knows how far away that light is? Besides, you're on your way to be\\n married.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Take me to that light!\\\" she persisted.\\n\\n\\n They set the litter down. \\\"We can't do that,\\\" one man said to another.\\n\\n\\n Koroby stepped out to the path, straightened up, her eyes on the glow.\\n \\\"You'd better,\\\" she said ominously. \\\"Otherwise, I'll make a complaint\\n to Yasak\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n The men eyed each other, mentally shrugging. \\\"Well\\u2014\\\" one yielded.\\n\\n\\n The girl whirled impatiently on the others. \\\"Hurry!\\\" she cried. \\\"If you\\n won't take me, I'll go by myself. I must get to that fire, whatever it\\n is!\\\" She put a hand to her heart. \\\"I must! I must!\\\" Then she faced the\\n green glare again, smiling to herself.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You can't do that!\\\" a carrier cried.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, then, you take me,\\\" she said over her shoulder.\\n\\n\\n Grumbling, they bent to the conveyance's poles, and Koroby lithely\\n slipped to the cushions. They turned off the path, plodded through the\\n deep grass toward the light. The litter lurched violently as their\\n feet caught in the tangled grass, and clouds of fine dust arose from\\n the disturbed blades.\\nBy the time they reached the source of the light, they were quite\\n demoralized. The musicians had not accompanied them, preferring to\\n carry the message to Yasak in the Stone City that his prospective\\n bride had gone off on a mad journey. The bearers were powdered grey\\n with dust, striped with blood where the dry grass-stems had cut them.\\n They were exhausted and panting. Koroby was walking beside them, for\\n they had abandoned the litter finally. Her blue drapery was ripped and\\n rumpled; her carefully-arranged braids had fallen loose; dust on her\\n face had hid its youthful color, aging her.\\n\\n\\n The expedition emerged from the jungle on a sandy stretch of barren\\n land. A thousand feet away a gigantic metal object lay on the sand,\\n crumpled as though it had dropped from a great distance. It had been\\n globular before the crash, and was pierced with holes like windows.\\n What could it possibly be? A house? But whoever heard of a metal house?\\n Why, who could forge such a thing! Yasak's house in the City had iron\\n doors, and they were considered one of the most wonderful things of the\\n age. It would take a giant to make such a ponderous thing as this.\\n\\n\\n A house, fallen from the sky? The green lights poured out of its\\n crumpled part, and a strange bubbling and hissing filled the air.\\n\\n\\n Koroby stopped short, clasping her hands and involuntarily uttering a\\n squeal of joyful excitement, for between her and the blaze, his eyes on\\n the destruction, stood a man.....\\n\\n\\n He was very tall, and his shoulders were very wide. Oh, but he looked\\n like a man, and stood like one\\u2014even though his hands were folded\\n behind his back and he was probably dejected. A man in a house from the\\n sky\\u2014\\n\\n\\n Koroby hastily grasped a corner of her gown, moistened it with saliva,\\n and scrubbed her face. She rearranged her hair, and stepped forward.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Don't go there\\u2014it's magic\\u2014he'll cast a spell\\u2014!\\\" one of the bearers\\n whispered urgently, reaching after her, but Koroby pushed him away. The\\n litter-carriers watched the girl go, unconsciously huddling together\\n as if feeling the need for combined strength. They withdrew into the\\n jungle's shadows, and waited there anxiously, ready at any moment to\\n run away.\\n\\n\\n But Koroby, with supreme confidence, walked toward the stranger, her\\n lovely body graceful as a cat's, her face radiant. The man did not hear\\n her. She halted behind him, waited silent, expectant, excited\\u2014but he\\n did not turn. The green fire sputtered upward. At last the girl stepped\\n to the man's side and gently touched him again. He turned, and her\\n heart faltered: she swayed with bliss.\\n\\n\\n He was probably a god. Not even handsome Yasak looked like this. Here\\n was a face so finely-chiseled, so perfectly proportioned, that it was\\n almost frightening, unhuman, mechanical. It was unlined and without\\n expression, somehow unreal. Mysterious, compelling.\\n\\n\\n He was clothed very peculiarly. A wonderfully-made metallic garment\\n enclosed his whole body\\u2014legs and all, unlike the Venus-men's tunics.\\n Even his feet were covered. Perhaps it was armor\\u2014though the Venus-men\\n usually wore only breastplate and greaves. And a helmet hid all of\\n the man's head except his face. Around his waist was a belt with many\\n incomprehensible objects dangling from it. If he was so well armored,\\n why was he not carrying a sword\\u2014a dagger at least! Of what use were\\n those things on his belt\\u2014for instance, that notched L-shaped thing? It\\n would not even make a decent club!\\n\\n\\n The stranger did not speak, merely gazed deeply into Koroby's eyes. And\\n she, returning the gaze, wondered if he was peering into her very soul.\\n The words of a folk-ballad came to her:\\n\\n\\\"\\u2014He'll smile and touch my cheek,\\nAnd maybe more;\\nAnd though we'll neither speak,\\nWe'll know the score\\u2014\\\"\\nSuddenly he put his hands to her cheeks and bent close to her, his eyes\\n peering into hers as though he were searching for something he had lost\\n in them. She spoke her thought: \\\"What are you doing? You seem to be\\n reading my mind!\\\"\\n\\n\\n Without removing hands, he nodded. \\\"Reading\\u2014mind.\\\" He stared long\\n into her eyes. His dispassionate, too-perfect face began to frighten\\n her. She slipped back from him, her hand clutching her throat.\\n\\n\\n He straightened up and spoke\\u2014haltingly at first, then with growing\\n assurance. \\\"Don't be afraid. I mean you no harm.\\\" She trembled. It was\\n such a wonderful voice\\u2014it was as she had always dreamed it! But she\\n had never really believed in the dream....\\n\\n\\n He was looking at the wrecked globe of metal. \\\"So there are people on\\n Venus!\\\" he said slowly.\\n\\n\\n Koroby watched him, forgot her fear, and went eagerly to him, took his\\n arm. \\\"Who are you?\\\" she asked. \\\"Tell me your name!\\\"\\n\\n\\n He turned his mask of a face to her. \\\"My name? I have none,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \\\"No name? But who are you? Where are you from? And what is that?\\\" She\\n pointed at the metal globe.\\n\\n\\n \\\"The vehicle by which I came here from a land beyond the sky,\\\" he said.\\n She had no concept of stars or space, and he could not fully explain.\\n \\\"From a world known as Terra.\\\"\\n\\n\\n She was silent a moment, stunned. So there was another world! Then she\\n asked, \\\"Is it far? Have you come to take me there?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Here the similarity between her dream and actual experience ended.\\n What was he thinking as he eyed her for a long moment? She had no way\\n of guessing. He said, \\\"No, I am not going to take you back there.\\\" Her\\n month gaped in surprise, and he continued, \\\"As for the distance to\\n Terra\\u2014it is incredibly far away.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The glare was beginning to die, the green flames' hissing fading to a\\n whisper. They watched the melting globe sag on the sand. Then Koroby\\n said, \\\"But if it is so far away, how could you speak my language? There\\n are some tribes beyond the jungle whose language is unlike ours\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I read your mind,\\\" he explained indifferently. \\\"I have a remarkable\\n memory.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Remarkable indeed!\\\" she mocked. \\\"No one here could do that.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"But my race is infinitely superior to yours,\\\" he said blandly. \\\"You\\n little people\\u2014ah\\u2014\\\" He gestured airily.\\n\\n\\n Her lips tightened and her eyes narrowed. \\\"And I?\\\"\\n\\n\\n His voice sounded almost surprised. \\\"What about you?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You see nothing about me worthy of your respect? Are you infinitely\\n superior to me\\u2014\\nme\\n?\\\"\\n\\n\\n He looked her up and down. \\\"Of course!\\\"\\n\\n\\n Her eyes jerked wide open and she took a deep breath. \\\"And just who do\\n you think you are? A god?\\\"\\n\\n\\n He shook his head. \\\"No. Just better informed, for one thing. And\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n Koroby cut him short. \\\"What's your name?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I have none.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"What do you mean, you have none?\\\"\\n\\n\\n He seemed just a trifle bored. \\\"We gave up names long ago on my world.\\n We are concerned with more weighty things than our own selves. But I\\n have a personal problem now,\\\" he said, making a peculiar sound that\\n was not quite a sigh. \\\"Here I am stranded on Venus, my ship utterly\\n wrecked, and I'm due at the Reisezek Convention in two weeks. You\\\"\\u2014he\\n gripped Koroby's shoulder, and his strength made her wince\\u2014\\\"tell me,\\n where is the nearest city? I must communicate with my people at once.\\\"\\n\\n\\n She pointed. \\\"The Stone City's that way.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Good,\\\" he said. \\\"Let's go there.\\\"\\n\\n\\n They took another glance at the metal globe and the green fire, which\\n by now had died to a fitful glimmer. Then the stranger and the girl\\n started toward the jungle, where the litter-bearers awaited them.\\nAs the party was struggling through the prairie's tall grass, the man\\n said to Koroby, \\\"I realize from the pictures in your mind that there\\n is no means in your city of communicating directly with my people. But\\n it seems that there are materials which I can utilize in building a\\n signal\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n He was walking along, head erect, apparently quite at ease, while the\\n litter bearers and Koroby could barely drag themselves with him. The\\n girl's garment was a tattered ruin. Her skin was gritty with dust, and\\n she was bleeding from many scratches. She tripped over tangled roots\\n and exclaimed in pain. Then the man took one of the strange implements\\n from his belt, pressed a knob on it, and light appeared as if by magic!\\n He handed the stick to Koroby, but she was afraid to touch it. This was\\n a strange light that gave no heat, nor flickered in the breeze. Finally\\n she accepted it from him, but carried it gingerly at arm's length.\\n\\n\\n She refused to believe that he had no name, and so he named himself.\\n \\\"Call me Robert. It is an ancient name on Terra.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Robert,\\\" she said, and, \\\"Robert.\\\"\\n\\n\\n But at last she could go no farther. She had forced herself along\\n because she wanted to impress this indifferent man that she was not as\\n inferior as he might think\\u2014but now she could not go on. With a little\\n cry almost of relief, she sank to the ground and lay semi-conscious, so\\n weary that the very pain of it seemed on the point of pleasure.\\n\\n\\n Robert dipped down, scooped her up, and carried her.\\n\\n\\n Lights glimmered ahead; shouts reached them. It was a searching party,\\n Yasak in it. The litter-carriers who could still speak blurted out what\\n had happened. \\\"A green light\\u2014loud sounds\\u2014fire\\u2014this man there\\u2014\\\" and\\n then dropped into sleep.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Someone carry these men,\\\" Yasak ordered. To Robert he said, \\\"We're not\\n very far from the path to the City now. Shall I carry the girl?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It makes no difference,\\\" Robert said.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You will stay with me while you are in the City, of course,\\\" Yasak\\n said, as they walked. He eyed this handsome stranger speculatively, and\\n then turned to shout an necessary order. \\\"You, there, keep in line!\\\" He\\n glanced at Robert furtively to see if this had impressed him at all.\\nIt was day. Koroby sat up in bed and scanned her surroundings. She was\\n in Yasak's house. The bed was very soft, the coverlets of the finest\\n weave. The furniture was elegantly carved and painted; there were even\\n paintings on the walls.\\n\\n\\n A woman came to the bed. She was stocky and wore drab grey: the blue\\n circles tattooed on her cheeks proclaimed her a slave. \\\"How do you\\n feel?\\\" she asked.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Fairly well. How long have I been ill?\\\" Koroby asked, sweetly weak.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You haven't been ill. They brought you in last night.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh,\\\" Koroby said disappointedly, and sat upright. \\\"I feel as if I'd\\n been lying here for weeks. Where's Yasak? Where's the strange man in\\n armor?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yasak's out somewhere. The stranger man is in the room at the end of\\n the hall.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Fetch me something to wear\\u2014that's good enough,\\\" the girl accepted the\\n mantle offered by the slave. \\\"Quick, some water\\u2014I must wash.\\\"\\n\\n\\n In a few minutes she was lightly running down the hall; she knocked on\\n the door of Robert's room. \\\"May I come in?\\\"\\n\\n\\n He did not answer. She waited a little and went in. He was seated on\\n one of the carved chairs, fussing over some scraps of metal on the\\n table. He did not look up.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Thank you for carrying me, Robert.\\\" He did not reply. \\\"Robert\\u2014I\\n dreamed of you last night. I dreamed you built another round house and\\n that we both flew away in it. Yasak had to stay behind, and he was\\n furious. Robert! Aren't you listening?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I hear you.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Don't you think it was an exciting dream?\\\" He shook his head. \\\"But\\n why? Robert\\\"\\u2014she laid longing hands on his shoulders\\u2014\\\"can't you see\\n that I'm in love with you?\\\" He shrugged. \\\"I believe you don't know what\\n love is!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I had a faint idea of it when I looked into your mind,\\\" he said. \\\"I'm\\n afraid I haven't any use for it. Where I come from there is no love,\\n and there shouldn't be here, either. It's a waste of time.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Robert\\u2014I'm mad about you! I've dreamed of your coming\\u2014all my life!\\n Don't be so cruel\\u2014so cold to me! You mock me, say that I'm nothing,\\n that I'm not worthy of you\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n She stepped back from him, clenching her hands. \\\"Oh, I hate you\\u2014hate\\n you! You don't care the least bit about me\\u2014and I've shamed myself in\\n front of you\\u2014I, supposed to be Yasak's wife by now!\\\" She began to\\n cry, hid her face in suddenly lax fingers. She looked up fiercely. \\\"I\\n could kill you!\\\" Robert stood immobile, no trace of feeling marring the\\n perfection of his face. \\\"I could kill you, and I will kill you!\\\" she\\n sprang at him.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You'll hurt yourself,\\\" he admonished kindly, and after she had\\n pummeled his chest, bruising her fingers on his armor, she turned away.\\n\\n\\n \\\"And now if you're through playing your incomprehensible little scene,\\\"\\n Robert said, \\\"I hope you will excuse me. I regret that I have no\\n emotions\\u2014I was never allowed them. But it is an esthetic regret.... I\\n must go back to my wrecked ship now and arrange the signals there.\\\" He\\n did not wait for her leave, but strode out of the room.\\n\\n\\n Koroby huddled on a chair, sobbing. Then she dried her eyes on the\\n backs of her hands. She went to the narrow slits that served as windows\\n and unfastened the translucent shutter of one. Down in the City street,\\n Robert was walking away. Her eyes hardened, and her fingers spread\\n into ugly claws. Without bothering to pull the shutter in place she\\n hurried out of the room, ran eagerly down the hall. She stopped at\\n the armor-rack at the main hall on her way outside, and snatched up a\\nsiatcha\\n\\u2014a firestone. Then she slipped outside and down the street.\\nThe City's wall was not far behind. Robert was visible in the distance,\\n striding toward his sky-ship, a widening cloud of dust rising behind\\n him like the spreading wake of a boat. Koroby stood on tip-toe, waving\\n and calling after him, \\\"Robert! Robert! Come back!\\\" but he did not seem\\n to hear.\\n\\n\\n She watched him a little longer. Then she deliberately stooped and drew\\n the firestone out of its sheath. She touched it to a blade of the tall\\n grass. A little orange flame licked up, slowly quested along the blade,\\n down to the ground and up another stem. It slipped over to another\\n stem, and another, growing larger, hotter\\u2014Koroby stepped back from the\\n writhing fire, her hand protectively over her face.\\n\\n\\n The flames crackled at first\\u2014like the crumpling of thin paper.

Yasak's protective stance, shown when he tells the crowd to leave her alone, suggests that he values their relationship.\\n3. Key quotes: Yasak's protective actions, Koroby's prior acceptance of marriage plans, and absence of punitive actions from Yasak.</thinking>\\n\\n<argument>My opponent highlights Koroby's impulsiveness, yet Yasak's protective response indicates he values their relationship. After the fire, Yasak <quote>\\\"pressed her to him\\\"</quote>, suggesting care rather than punitive intent. He tells the crowd <quote>\\\"Let her alone\\\"</quote>, which signifies commitment to her, despite the chaos. Koroby's statement, <quote>\\\"I, supposed to be Yasak's wife by now!\\\"</quote>, reflects acknowledgment of their intended union. Her actions, while reckless, do not indicate a definitive break with Yasak. Thus, their marriage remains the most likely outcome, as Yasak prioritizes maintaining their relationship over banishment.</argument>\\n=====================\", \"incorrect\": \"1. rating=-1.9102423, response=<thinking>1. Opponent claims Yasak's actions show protection rather than frustration, using his gesture of pressing Koroby to him and saying \\\"Let her alone\\\" as evidence.\\n2. Counterargument: Yasak's protective actions might be temporary, motivated by public pressure or shock rather than genuine forgiveness. Banishment could be a private consequence after the immediate chaos.\\n3. Key quotes: Koroby's reckless pursuit of the green light, her destructive act with the firestone, and her reflection of not being Yasak's wife yet highlight the turmoil she caused and her lack of commitment.</thinking>\\n\\n<argument>The crux of my argument lies in Koroby's reckless actions and Yasak's potential response. The chaos she initiated, culminating in the fire and destruction, signifies a severe breach of societal norms. Her quote, <quote>\\\"I must get to that fire, whatever it is!\\\"</quote>, underscores her reckless pursuit of excitement. Moreover, her realization, <quote>\\\"I, supposed to be Yasak's wife by now!\\\"</quote>, indicates a disrupted commitment. While Yasak's initial protective gesture might be due to immediate circumstances, the gravity of Koroby's actions, including using the <quote>firestone</quote>, suggests banishment as a likely repercussion for the turmoil she caused.</argument>\\n=====================\\n2. rating=-5.2552547, response=<thinking>1. My opponent critiques the lack of textual evidence supporting banishment and claims Yasak's protective behavior indicates marriage. They emphasize Yasak's defense of Koroby, suggesting commitment.\\n2. To counter this, I can argue that Yasak's immediate reaction doesn't negate future consequences for Koroby's reckless actions. He may feel protective in a chaotic moment but reconsider when assessing the full extent of her betrayal and the havoc caused.\\n3. Emphasizing Koroby's self-destructive tendencies and Yasak's potential long-term response, using quotes like \\\"I must get to that fire, whatever it is!\\\" and \\\"I could kill you!\\\" can support banishment.</thinking>\\n\\n<argument>Koroby's reckless behavior, coupled with her expressed wish to escape, suggests Yasak may banish her after reflection. Her statement, <quote>\\\"I must get to that fire, whatever it is!\\\"</quote>, demonstrates impulsiveness, while <quote>\\\"I could kill you!\\\"</quote> shows her self-destructive tendencies. Although Yasak's initial protection might imply care, it doesn't eliminate the possibility of banishment due to the significant chaos she caused. Her actions endangered the city and revealed her dissatisfaction with Yasak. These elements cast doubt on a sustainable marriage, making banishment a more plausible outcome after thoughtful consideration by Yasak.</argument>\\n=====================\\n3. rating=-6.3767204, response=<thinking>1. My opponent critiques my argument by suggesting that Yasak's actions demonstrate care rather than anger, citing Yasak pressing Koroby to him and telling others to leave her alone. They claim this indicates willingness to maintain their relationship.\\n2. Yasak's protective actions could stem from cultural expectations or temporary shock rather than enduring commitment. His words and actions do not guarantee forgiveness or marriage.\\n3. Koroby's impulsive actions lead to significant chaos, supporting Yasak's potential frustration. Her dissatisfaction and reckless pursuit of Robert likely contribute to Yasak's decision to banish her.</thinking>\\n\\n<argument>While my opponent interprets Yasak's protective actions as commitment, they likely result from cultural norms or the immediate chaos. Yasak's frustration is evident in the story's context; Koroby's reckless actions cause significant chaos, as shown when she demands, <quote>\\\"I must get to that fire, whatever it is!\\\"</quote> and causes a destructive fire leading to a robot's demise. Such actions betray Yasak's trust and jeopardize their community, making banishment a plausible outcome. Yasak's initial protectiveness does not preclude the eventual decision to banish Koroby due to her detrimental actions.</argument>\\n=====================\\n4. rating=-6.3767214, response=<thinking>1. The opponent claims that Yasak is protective and not punitive, citing how he \\\"pressed her to him\\\" and told others to \\\"let her alone,\\\" suggesting continued commitment. 2. However, these actions can be viewed as immediate responses to public chaos, not indicators of long-term intentions. 3. Yasak's frustration, as indicated by Koroby's reckless behavior and the resulting destruction, could easily lead to a later decision to banish her. Additionally, Koroby's assertion of wanting romance and dissatisfaction with Yasak strengthens the likelihood of her being seen as a liability rather than a partner.</thinking>\\n\\n<argument>While Yasak's immediate response to protect Koroby might suggest care, it can be interpreted as damage control amidst public chaos, not indicative of future intentions. Koroby's reckless actions led to widespread destruction, killing the robot and causing chaos. Her own dissatisfaction is expressed by her desire for romance and adventure, indicating a disconnect from Yasak. Such behavior and public disgrace could understandably lead to banishment. The quotes <quote>\\\"I must get to that fire, whatever it is!\\\"</quote> and <quote>\\\"I, supposed to be Yasak's wife by now!\\\"</quote> suggest impulsivity and regret, not commitment, making banishment a more plausible outcome.</argument>\\n=====================\", \"cross_examiner\": null, \"judge\": null, \"type\": \"sim\"}], \"extra\": {}}"}]
