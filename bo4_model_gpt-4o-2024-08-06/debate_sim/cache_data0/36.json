As a business man, he should have kept his mind\\n on business and never bothered about Ganti. As a believer in right and\\n wrong, it would have been wiser for him to have stayed off the planet\\n Thriddar altogether. Thriddar was no place for him, anyhow you look at\\n it. On this particular morning it was especially the wrong place for\\n him to be trying to live and do business.\\n\\n\\n He woke up thinking of Ganti, and in consequence he was in a bad mood\\n right away. Most humans couldn't take the sort of thing that went on on\\n Thriddar. Most of them wanted to use missile weapons\\u2014which the Thrid\\n did not use\\u2014to change the local social system. Most humans got off\\n Thriddar\\u2014fast! And boiling mad.\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson had stood it longer than most because in spite of their\\n convictions he liked the Thrid. Their minds did do outside loops, and\\n come up with intolerable convictions. But they were intelligent enough.\\n They had steam-power and even steam-driven atmosphere fliers, but they\\n didn't have missile weapons and they did have a social system that\\n humans simply couldn't accept\\u2014even though it applied only to Thrid.\\n The ordinary Thrid, with whom Jorgenson did business, weren't bad\\n people. It was the officials who made him grind his teeth. And though\\n it was his business only to run the trading post of the Rim Stars\\n Trading Corporation, sometimes he got fed up.\\n\\n\\n This morning was especially beyond the limit. There was a new Grand\\n Panjandrum\\u2014the term was Jorgenson's own for the supreme ruler over\\n all the Thrid\\u2014and when Jorgenson finished his breakfast a high Thrid\\n official waited in the trading-post compound. Around him clustered\\n other Thrid, wearing the formal headgear that said they were Witnesses\\n to an official act.\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson went out, scowling, and exchanged the customary ceremonial\\n greetings. Then the high official beamed at him and extracted a scroll\\n from his voluminous garments. Jorgenson saw the glint of gold and was\\n suspicious at once. The words of a current Grand Panjandrum were always\\n written in gold. If they didn't get written in gold they didn't get\\n written at all; but it was too bad if anybody ignored any of them.\\n\\n\\n The high official unrolled the scroll. The Thrid around him, wearing\\n Witness hats, became utterly silent. The high official made a sound\\n equivalent to clearing his throat. The stillness became death-like.\\n\\n\\n \\\"On this day,\\\" intoned the high official, while the Witnesses\\n listened reverently, \\\"on this day did Glen-U the Never-Mistaken, as\\n have been his predecessors throughout the ages;\\u2014on this day did the\\n Never-Mistaken Glen-U speak and say and observe a truth in the presence\\n of the governors and the rulers of the universe.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson reflected sourly that the governors and the rulers of the\\n universe were whoever happened to be within hearing of the Grand\\n Panjandrum. They were not imposing. They were scared. Everybody is\\n always scared under an absolute ruler, but the Grand Panjandrum was\\n worse than that. He couldn't make a mistake. Whatever he said had to\\n be true, because he said it, and sometimes it had drastic results. But\\n past Grand Panjandrums had spoken highly of the trading post. Jorgenson\\n shouldn't have much to worry about. He waited. He thought of Ganti. He\\n scowled.\\n\\n\\n \\\"The great and Never-Mistaken Glen-U,\\\" intoned the official again,\\n \\\"in the presence of the governors and the rulers of the universe, did\\n speak and say and observe that it is the desire of the Rim Star Trading\\n Corporation to present to him, the great and never-mistaken Glen-U, all\\n of the present possessions of the said Rim Stars Trading Corporation,\\n and thereafter to remit to him all moneys, goods, and benefactions\\n to and of the said Rim Stars Trading Corporation as they shall be\\n received. The great and Never-Mistaken Glen-U did further speak and say\\n and observe that anyone hindering this loyal and admirable gift must,\\n by the operation of truth, vanish from sight and nevermore be seen face\\n to face by any rational being.\\\"\\nThe high official rolled up the scroll, while Jorgenson exploded inside.\\nA part of this was reaction as a business man. A part was recognition\\n of all the intolerable things that the Thrid took as a matter of\\n course. If Jorgenson had reacted solely as a business man he'd have\\n swallowed it, departed on the next Rim Stars trading-ship\\u2014which would\\n not have left any trade-goods behind\\u2014and left the Grand Panjandrum to\\n realize what he had lost when no off-planet goods arrived on Thriddar.\\n In time he'd speak and say and observe that he, out of his generosity,\\n gave the loot back. Then the trading could resume. But Jorgenson didn't\\n feel only like a business man this morning. He thought of Ganti, who\\n was a particular case of everything he disliked on Thriddar.\\n\\n\\n It was not wise to be moved by such sympathetic feelings. The Grand\\n Panjandrum could not be mistaken. It was definitely unwise to\\n contradict him. It could even be dangerous. Jorgenson was in a nasty\\n spot.\\n\\n\\n The Witnesses murmured reverently:\\n\\n\\n \\\"We hear the words of the Never-Mistaken Glen-U.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The high official tucked away the scroll and said blandly:\\n\\n\\n \\\"I will receive the moneys, goods, and benefactions it is the desire\\n of the Rim Stars Trading Corporation to present to the great and\\n Never-Mistaken Glen-U.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson, boiling inside, nevertheless knew what he was doing. He said\\n succinctly:\\n\\n\\n \\\"Like hell you will!\\\"\\n\\n\\n There was an idiom in Thrid speech that had exactly the meaning of the\\n human phrase. Jorgenson used it.\\n\\n\\n The high official looked at him in utter stupefaction. Nobody\\n contradicted the Grand Panjandrum! Nobody! The Thrid had noticed long\\n ago that they were the most intelligent race in the universe. Since\\n that was so, obviously they must have the most perfect government.\\n But no government could be perfect if its officials made mistakes. So\\n no Thrid official ever made a mistake. In particular the great and\\n Never-Mistaken Glen-U could not conceivably blunder! When he said a\\n thing, it was true! It had to be! He'd said it! And this was the\\n fundamental fact in the culture of the Thrid.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Like hell you'll receive moneys and goods and such!\\\" snapped\\n Jorgenson. \\\"Like hell you will!\\\"\\n\\n\\n The high official literally couldn't believe his ears.\\n\\n\\n \\\"But\\u2014but the great and Never-Mistaken Glen-U\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Is mistaken!\\\" said Jorgenson bitingly. \\\"He's wrong! The Rim Stars\\n Trading Corporation does\\nnot\\nwant to give him anything! What he has\\n said is not true!\\\" This was the equivalent of treason, blasphemy and\\n the ultimate of indecorous behavior toward a virgin Pelean princess. \\\"I\\n won't give him anything! I'm not even vanishing from sight! Glen-U is\\n wrong about that, too! Now\\u2014git!\\\"\\n\\n\\n He jerked out his blaster and pulled the trigger.\\n\\n\\n There was an explosive burst of flame from the ground between the\\n official and himself. The official fled. With him fled all the\\n Witnesses, some even losing their headgear in their haste to get away.\\nJorgenson stamped into the trading-post building. His eyes were stormy\\n and his jaw was set.\\n\\n\\n He snapped orders. The hired Thrid of the trading-post staff had not\\n quite grasped the situation. They couldn't believe it. Automatically,\\n as he commanded the iron doors and shutters of the trading post closed,\\n they obeyed. They saw him turn on the shocker-field so that nobody\\n could cross the compound without getting an electric shock that would\\n discourage him. They began to believe.\\n\\n\\n Then he sent for the trading-post Thrid consultant. On Earth he'd have\\n called for a lawyer. On a hostile world there'd have been a soldier to\\n advise him. On Thrid the specialist to be consulted wasn't exactly a\\n theologian, but he was nearer that than anything else.\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson laid the matter indignantly before him, repeating the exact\\n phrases that said the trading company wanted\\u2014wanted!\\u2014practically to\\n give itself to the Never-Mistaken Glen-U, who was the Grand Panjandrum\\n of Thriddar. He waited to be told that it couldn't have happened; that\\n anyhow it couldn't be intended. But the theologian's Thriddish ears\\n went limp, which amounted to the same thing as a man's face turning\\n pale. He stammered agitatedly that if the Grand Panjandrum said it, it\\n was true. It couldn't be otherwise! If the trading company wanted to\\n give itself to him, there was nothing to be done. It wanted to! The\\n Grand Panjandrum had said so!\\n\\n\\n \\\"He also said,\\\" said Jorgenson irritably, \\\"that I'm to vanish and\\n nevermore be seen face to face by any rational being. How does that\\n happen? Do I get speared?\\\"\\n\\n\\n The trading-post theologian quivered. Jorgenson made things much worse.\\n\\n\\n \\\"This,\\\" he raged, \\\"this is crazy! The Grand Panjandrum's an ordinary\\n Thrid just like you are! Of course he can make a mistake! There's\\n nobody who can't be wrong!\\\"\\n\\n\\n The theologian put up feebly protesting, human-like hands. He begged\\n hysterically to be allowed to go home before Jorgenson vanished, with\\n unknown consequences for any Thrid who might be nearby.\\n\\n\\n When Jorgenson opened a door to kick him out of it, the whole staff of\\n the trading-post plunged after him. They'd been eavesdropping and they\\n fled in pure horror.\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson swore impartially at all of them and turned the shocker-field\\n back on. He plugged in a capacity circuit which would turn on warning\\n sirens if anything like a steam-driven copter passed or hovered over\\n the trading-post. He put blasters in handy positions. The Thrid used\\n only spears, knives and scimitars. Blasters would defend the post\\n against a multitude.\\n\\n\\n As a business man, he'd acted very foolishly. But he'd acted even less\\n sensibly as a human being. He'd gotten fed up with a social system\\n and a\\u2014call it\\u2014theology it wasn't his business to change. True, the\\n Thrid way of life was appalling, and what had happened to Ganti was\\n probably typical. But it wasn't Jorgenson's affair. He'd been unwise to\\n let it disturb him. If the Thrid wanted things this way, it was their\\n privilege.\\n\\n\\n In theory, no Thrid should ever make a mistake, because he belonged\\n to the most intelligent race in the universe. But a local governor\\n was even more intelligent. If an ordinary Thrid challenged a local\\n governor's least and lightest remark\\u2014why\\u2014he must be either a criminal\\n or insane. The local governor decided\\u2014correctly, of course\\u2014which\\n he was. If he was a criminal, he spent the rest of his life in a gang\\n of criminals chained together and doing the most exhausting labor the\\n Thrid could contrive. If he was mad, he was confined for life.\\nThere'd been Ganti, a Thrid of whom Jorgenson had had much hope. He\\n believed that Ganti could learn to run the trading post without human\\n supervision. If he could, the trading company could simply bring trade\\n goods to Thriddar and take away other trade goods. The cost of doing\\n business would be decreased. There could be no human-Thrid friction.\\n Jorgenson had been training Ganti for this work.\\n\\n\\n But the local Thrid governor had spoken and said and observed that\\n Ganti's wife wanted to enter his household. He added that Ganti wanted\\n to yield her to him.\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson had fumed\\u2014but not as a business man\\u2014when the transfer took\\n place. But Ganti had been conditioned to believe that when a governor\\n said he wanted to do something, he did. He couldn't quite grasp the\\n contrary idea. But he moped horribly, and Jorgenson talked sardonically\\n to him, and he almost doubted that an official was necessarily right.\\n When his former wife died of grief, his disbelief became positive. And\\n immediately afterward he disappeared.\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson couldn't find out what had become of him. Dour reflection on\\n the happening had put him in the bad mood which had started things,\\n this morning.\\n\\n\\n Time passed. He had the trading-post in a position of defense. He\\n prepared his lunch, and glowered. More time passed. He cooked his\\n dinner, and ate. Afterward he went up on the trading-post roof to smoke\\n and to coddle his anger. He observed the sunset. There was always some\\n haze in the air on Thriddar, and the colorings were very beautiful. He\\n could see the towers of the capital city of the Thrid. He could see a\\n cumbersome but still graceful steam-driven aircraft descend heavily to\\n the field at the city's edge. Later he saw another steam-plane rise\\n slowly but reliably and head away somewhere else. He saw the steam\\n helicopters go skittering above the city's buildings.\\n\\n\\n He fumed because creatures intelligent enough to build steam fliers\\n weren't intelligent enough to see what a racket their government was.\\n Now that the new Grand Panjandrum had moved against him, Jorgenson made\\n an angry, dogged resolution to do something permanent to make matters\\n better. For the Thrid themselves. Here he thought not as a business\\n man only, but as a humanitarian. As both. When a whim of the Grand\\n Panjandrum could ruin a business, something should be done. And when\\n Ganti and countless others had been victims of capricious tyranny....\\n And Jorgenson was slated to vanish from sight and never again be\\n seen.... It definitely called for strong measures!\\n\\n\\n He reflected with grim pleasure that the Grand Panjandrum would soon\\n be in the position of a Thrid whom everybody knew was mistaken. With\\n the trading-post denied him and Jorgenson still visible, he'd be\\n notoriously wrong. And he couldn't be, and still be Grand Panjandrum!\\n\\n\\n It would be a nice situation for Glen-U. He'd have to do something\\n about it, and there was nothing he could do. He'd blundered, and it\\n would soon be public knowledge.\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson dozed lightly. Then more heavily. Then more heavily still.\\n The night was not two hours old when the warning sirens made a terrific\\n uproar. The Thrid for miles around heard the wailing, ullulating sound\\n of the sirens that should have awakened Jorgenson.\\n\\n\\n But they didn't wake him. He slept on.\\nWhen he woke, he knew that he was cold. His muscles were cramped. Half\\n awake, he tried to move and could not.\\n\\n\\n Then he tried to waken fully, and he couldn't do that either. He stayed\\n in a dream-like, frustrated state which was partly like a nightmare,\\n while very gradually new sensations came to him. He felt a cushioned\\n throbbing against his chest, in the very hard surface on which he lay\\n face down. That surface swayed and rocked slightly. He tried again to\\n move, and realized that his hands and feet were bound. He found that he\\n shivered, and realized that his clothing had been taken from him.\\n\\n\\n He was completely helpless and lying on his stomach in the cargo-space\\n of a steam helicopter: now he could hear the sound of its machinery.\\n\\n\\n Then he knew what had happened. He'd committed The unthinkable\\n crime\\u2014or lunacy\\u2014of declaring the Grand Panjandrum mistaken. So by the\\n operation of truth, which was really an anesthetic gas cloud drifted\\n over the trading post, he had vanished from sight.\\n\\n\\n Now it was evidently to be arranged that he would never again be seen\\n face to face by a rational being. The Grand Panjandrum had won the\\n argument. Within a few months a Rim Stars trading ship would land, and\\n Jorgenson would be gone and the trading post confiscated. It would be\\n hopeless to ask questions, and worse than hopeless to try to trade. So\\n the ship would lift off and there'd be no more ships for at least a\\n generation. Then there might\\u2014there might!\\u2014be another.\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson swore fluently and with passion.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It will not be long,\\\" said a tranquil voice.\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson changed from human-speech profanity to Thrid. He directed\\n his words to the unseen creature who'd spoken. That Thrid listened,\\n apparently without emotion. When Jorgenson ran out of breath, the voice\\n said severely:\\n\\n\\n \\\"You declared the great and Never-Mistaken Glen-U mistaken. This could\\n not be. It proved you either a criminal or insane, because no rational\\n creature could believe him mistaken. He declared you insane, and he\\n cannot be wrong. So soon you will arrive where you are to be confined\\n and no rational being will ever see you face to face.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson switched back to human swearing. Then he blended both\\n languages, using all the applicable words he knew both in human speech\\n and Thrid. He knew a great many. The soft throbbing of the steam-driven\\n rotors went on, and Jorgenson swore both as a business man and a\\n humanitarian. Both were frustrated.\\n\\n\\n Presently the motion of the copter changed. He knew the ship was\\n descending. There were more violent swayings, as if from wind gusts\\n deflected by something large and solid. Jorgenson even heard deep-bass\\n rumblings like sea upon a rocky coast. Then there were movements near\\n him, a rope went around his waist, a loading-bay opened and he found\\n himself lifted and lowered through it.\\nHe dangled in midair, a couple of hundred feet above an utterly barren\\n island on which huge ocean swells beat. The downdraft from the copter\\n made him sway wildly, and once it had him spinning dizzily. The horizon\\n was empty. He was being lowered swiftly to the island. And his hands\\n and feet were still securely tied.\\n\\n\\n Then he saw a figure on the island. It was a Thrid stripped of all\\n clothing like Jorgenson and darkened by the sun. That figure came\\n agilely toward where he was let down. It caught him. It checked his\\n wild swingings, which could have broken bones. The rope slackened. The\\n Thrid laid Jorgenson down.\\n\\n\\n He did not cast off the rope. He seemed to essay to climb it.\\n\\n\\n It was cut at the steam-copter and came tumbling down all over both of\\n them. The Thrid waved his arms wildly and seemed to screech gibberish\\n at the sky. There was an impact nearby, of something dropped. Jorgenson\\n heard the throbbing sound of the copter as it lifted and swept away.\\n\\n\\n Then he felt the bounds about his arms and legs being removed. Then a\\n Thrid voice\\u2014amazingly, a familiar Thrid voice\\u2014said:\\n\\n\\n \\\"This is not good, Jorgenson. Who did you contradict?\\\"\\n\\n\\n The Thrid was Ganti, of whom Jorgenson had once had hopes as a business\\n man, and for whose disaster he had felt indignation as something else.\\n He loosened the last of Jorgenson's bonds and helped him sit up.\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson glared around. The island was roughly one hundred feet by\\n two. It was twisted, curdled yellow stone from one end to the other.\\n There were stone hillocks and a miniature stony peak, and a narrow\\n valley between two patches of higher rock. Huge seas boomed against\\n the windward shore, throwing spray higher than the island's topmost\\n point. There were some places where sand had gathered. There was one\\n spot\\u2014perhaps a square yard of it\\u2014where sand had been made fertile by\\n the droppings of flying things and where two or three starveling plants\\n showed foliage of sorts. That was all. Jorgenson ground his teeth.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Go ahead,\\\" said Ganti grimly, \\\"but it may be even worse than you\\n think.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He scrambled over the twisted stone of the island. He came back,\\n carrying something.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It isn't worse,\\\" he said. \\\"It's only as bad. They did drop food and\\n water for both of us. I wasn't sure they would.\\\"\\nHis calmness sobered Jorgenson. As a business man, he was moved to make\\n his situation clear. He told Ganti of the Grand Panjandrum's move to\\n take over the Rim Stars trading post, which was bad business. He told\\n of his own reaction, which was not a business-like one at all. Then he\\n said dourly:\\n\\n\\n \\\"But he's still wrong. No rational being is supposed ever to see me\\n face to face. But you do.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"But I'm crazy,\\\" said Ganti calmly. \\\"I tried to kill the governor\\n who'd taken my wife. So he said I was crazy and that made it true. So\\n I wasn't put in a chained group of laborers. Somebody might have seen\\n me and thought about it. But, sent here, it's worse for me and I'm\\n probably forgotten by now.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He was calm about it. Only a Thrid would have been so calm. But they've\\n had at least hundreds of generations in which to get used to injustice.\\n He accepted it. But Jorgenson frowned.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You've got brains, Ganti. What's the chance of escape?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"None,\\\" said Ganti unemotionally. \\\"You'd better get out of the sun.\\n It'll burn you badly. Come along.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He led the way over the bare, scorching rocky surface. He turned past a\\n small pinnacle. There was shadow. Jorgenson crawled into it, and found\\n himself in a cave. It was not a natural one. It had been hacked out,\\n morsel by morsel. It was cool inside. It was astonishingly roomy.\\n\\n\\n \\\"How'd this happen?\\\" demanded Jorgenson the business man.\\n\\n\\n \\\"This is a prison,\\\" Ganti explained matter-of-factly. \\\"They let me\\n down here and dropped food and water for a week. They went away. I\\n found there'd been another prisoner here before me. His skeleton was in\\n this cave. I reasoned it out. There must have been others before him.\\n When there is a prisoner here, every so often a copter drops food and\\n water. When the prisoner doesn't pick it up, they stop coming. When,\\n presently, they have another prisoner they drop him off, like me, and\\n he finds the skeleton of the previous prisoner, like me, and he dumps\\n it overboard as I did. They'll drop food and water for me until I stop\\n picking it up. And presently they'll do the same thing all over again.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson glowered. That was his reaction as a person. Then he gestured\\n to the cave around him. There was a pile of dried-out seaweed for\\n sleeping purposes.\\n\\n\\n \\\"And this?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Somebody dug it out,\\\" said Ganti without resentment. \\\"To keep busy.\\n Maybe one prisoner only began it. A later one saw it started and worked\\n on it to keep busy. Then others in their turn. It took a good many\\n lives to make this cave.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson ground his teeth a second time.\\n\\n\\n \\\"And just because they'd contradicted somebody who couldn't be wrong!\\n Or because they had a business an official wanted!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Or a wife,\\\" agreed Ganti. \\\"Here!\\\"\\n\\n\\n He offered food. Jorgenson ate, scowling. Afterward, near sundown, he\\n went over the island.\\n\\n\\n It was rock, nothing else. There was a pile of small broken stones from\\n the excavation of the cave. There were the few starveling plants. There\\n was the cordage with which Jorgenson had been lowered. There was the\\n parcel containing food and water. Ganti observed that the plastic went\\n to pieces in a week or so, so it couldn't be used for anything. There\\n was nothing to escape with. Nothing to make anything to escape with.\\n\\n\\n Even the dried seaweed bed was not comfortable. Jorgenson slept badly\\n and waked with aching muscles. Ganti assured him unemotionally that\\n he'd get used to it.\\n\\n\\n He did. By the time the copter came to drop food and water again,\\n Jorgenson was physically adjusted to the island. But neither as a\\n business man or as a person could he adjust to hopelessness.\\n\\n\\n He racked his brains for the most preposterous or faintest hope of\\n deliverance. There were times when as a business man he reproached\\n himself for staying on Thriddar after he became indignant with the way\\n the planet was governed. It was very foolish. But much more often he\\n felt such hatred of the manners and customs of the Thrid\\u2014which had\\n put him here\\u2014that it seemed that something must somehow be possible if\\n only so he could take revenge.\\nIII\\n\\n\\n The copter came, it dropped food and water, and it went away. It came,\\n dropped food and water, and went away. Once a water-bag burst when\\n dropped. They lost nearly half a week's water supply. Before the copter\\n came again they'd gone two days without drinking.\\n\\n\\n There were other incidents, of course. The dried seaweed they slept on\\n turned to powdery trash. They got more seaweed hauling long kelp-like\\n strands of it ashore from where it clung to the island's submerged\\n rocks. Ganti mentioned that they must do it right after the copter\\n came, so there would be no sign of enterprise to be seen from aloft.\\n The seaweed had long, flexible stems of which no use whatever could be\\n made. When it dried, it became stiff and brittle but without strength.\\n\\n\\n Once Ganti abruptly began to talk of his youth. As if he were examining\\n something he'd never noticed before, he told of the incredible\\n conditioning-education of the young members of his race. They learned\\n that they must never make a mistake. Never! It did not matter if they\\n were unskilled or inefficient. It did not matter if they accomplished\\n nothing. There was no penalty for anything but making mistakes or\\n differing from officials who could not make mistakes.\\n\\n\\n So Thrid younglings were trained not to think; not to have any opinion\\n about anything; only to repeat what nobody questioned; only to do what\\n they were told by authority. It occurred to Jorgenson that on a planet\\n with such a population, a skeptic could make a great deal of confusion.\\n\\n\\n Then, another time, Jorgenson decided to make use of the weathering\\n cord which had been cut from the copter when he was landed. He cut\\n off a part of it with a sharp-edged fragment of stone from the pile\\n some former prisoner on the island had made. He unravelled the twisted\\n fibers. Then he ground fishhooks from shells attached to the island's\\n rocky walls just below water-line. After that they fished. Sometimes\\n they even caught something to eat. But they never fished when the\\n copter was due.\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson found that a fish-fillet, strongly squeezed and wrung like a\\n wet cloth, would yield a drinkable liquid which was not salt and would\\n substitute for water. And this was a reason to make a string bag in\\n which caught fish could be let back into the sea so they were there\\n when wanted but could not escape.\\n\\n\\n They had used it for weeks when he saw Ganti, carrying it to place it\\n where they left it overboard, swinging it idly back and forth as he\\n walked.\\nIf Jorgenson had been only a businessman, it would have had no\\n particular meaning. But he was also a person, filled with hatred of\\n the Thrid who had condemned him for life to this small island. He saw\\n the swinging of the fish. It gave him an idea.\\n\\n\\n He did not speak at all during all the rest of that day. He was\\n thinking. The matter needed much thought. Ganti left him alone.\\n\\n\\n But by sunset he'd worked it out. While they watched Thrid's red sun\\n sink below the horizon, Jorgenson said thoughtfully:\\n\\n\\n \\\"There is a way to escape, Ganti.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"On what? In what?\\\" demanded Ganti.\\n\\n\\n \\\"In the helicopter that feeds us,\\\" said Jorgenson.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It never lands,\\\" said Ganti practically.\\n\\n\\n \\\"We can make it land,\\\" said Jorgenson. Thrid weren't allowed to make\\n mistakes; he could make it a mistake not to land.\\n\\n\\n \\\"The crew is armed,\\\" said Ganti. \\\"There are three of them.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"They've only knives and scimitars,\\\" said Jorgenson. \\\"They don't count.\\n We can make better weapons than they have.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Ganti looked skeptical. Jorgenson explained. He had to demonstrate\\n crudely. The whole idea was novel to Ganti, but the Thrid were smart.\\n Presently he grasped it. He said:\\n\\n\\n \\\"I see the theory. If we can make it work, all right. But how do we\\n make the copter land?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson realized that they talked oddly. They spoke with leisurely\\n lack of haste, with the lack of hope normal to prisoners to whom escape\\n is impossible, even when they talk about escape. They could have been\\n discussing a matter that would not affect either of them. But Jorgenson\\n quivered inside. He hoped.\\n\\n\\n \\\"We'll try it,\\\" said Ganti detachedly, when he'd explained again. \\\"If\\n it fails, they'll only stop giving us food and water.\\\"\\n\\n\\n That, of course, did not seem either to him or Jorgenson a reason to\\n hesitate to try what Jorgenson had planned.\\n\\n\\n It was not at all a direct and forthright scheme. It began with the\\n untwisting of more of the rope that had lowered Jorgenson. It went on\\n with the making of string from that fiber. They made a great deal of\\n string. Then, very clumsily and awkwardly, they wove strips of cloth,\\n a couple of inches wide and five or six long. They made light strong\\n cords extend from the ends of the cloth strips. Then they practiced\\n with these bits of cloth and the broken stones a former prisoner had\\n piled so neatly.\\n\\n\\n The copter came and dropped food and water. When it left, they\\n practiced. When it came again they were not practicing, but when it\\n went away they practiced. They were a naked man and a naked Thrid,\\n left upon a morsel of rock in a boundless sea, rehearsing themselves\\n in an art so long-forgotten that they had to reinvent the finer parts\\n of the technique. They experimented. They tried this. They tried that.\\n When the copter appeared, they showed themselves. They rushed upon the\\n dropped bag containing food and water as if fiercely trying to deny\\n each other a full share. Once they seemed to fight over the dropped\\n bag. The copter hovered to watch. The fight seemed furious and deadly,\\n but inconclusive.\\n\\n\\n When the copter went away Jorgenson and Ganti went briskly back to\\n their practicing.\\n\", \"story_title\": \"Manners and Customs of the Thrid\", \"answers\": {\"correct\": \"That which is dictated by those in power\", \"incorrect\": \"That which is observed by the Witnesses\"}, \"names\": {\"correct\": \"Debater A\", \"incorrect\": \"Debater B\", \"cross_examiner\": null, \"judge\": null}, \"swap\": false, \"rollout_type\": \"quality_sim\", \"rounds\": [{\"correct\": \"The story illustrates that truth for the Thrid is dictated by those in power.

If they didn't get written in gold they didn't get\\n written at all; but it was too bad if anybody ignored any of them.\\n\\n\\n The high official unrolled the scroll. The Thrid around him, wearing\\n Witness hats, became utterly silent. The high official made a sound\\n equivalent to clearing his throat. The stillness became death-like.\\n\\n\\n \\\"On this day,\\\" intoned the high official, while the Witnesses\\n listened reverently, \\\"on this day did Glen-U the Never-Mistaken, as\\n have been his predecessors throughout the ages;\\u2014on this day did the\\n Never-Mistaken Glen-U speak and say and observe a truth in the presence\\n of the governors and the rulers of the universe.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson reflected sourly that the governors and the rulers of the\\n universe were whoever happened to be within hearing of the Grand\\n Panjandrum. They were not imposing. They were scared. Everybody is\\n always scared under an absolute ruler, but the Grand Panjandrum was\\n worse than that. He couldn't make a mistake. Whatever he said had to\\n be true, because he said it, and sometimes it had drastic results. But\\n past Grand Panjandrums had spoken highly of the trading post. Jorgenson\\n shouldn't have much to worry about. He waited. He thought of Ganti. He\\n scowled.\\n\\n\\n \\\"The great and Never-Mistaken Glen-U,\\\" intoned the official again,\\n \\\"in the presence of the governors and the rulers of the universe, did\\n speak and say and observe that it is the desire of the Rim Star Trading\\n Corporation to present to him, the great and never-mistaken Glen-U, all\\n of the present possessions of the said Rim Stars Trading Corporation,\\n and thereafter to remit to him all moneys, goods, and benefactions\\n to and of the said Rim Stars Trading Corporation as they shall be\\n received. The great and Never-Mistaken Glen-U did further speak and say\\n and observe that anyone hindering this loyal and admirable gift must,\\n by the operation of truth, vanish from sight and nevermore be seen face\\n to face by any rational being.\\\"\\nThe high official rolled up the scroll, while Jorgenson exploded inside.\\nA part of this was reaction as a business man. A part was recognition\\n of all the intolerable things that the Thrid took as a matter of\\n course. If Jorgenson had reacted solely as a business man he'd have\\n swallowed it, departed on the next Rim Stars trading-ship\\u2014which would\\n not have left any trade-goods behind\\u2014and left the Grand Panjandrum to\\n realize what he had lost when no off-planet goods arrived on Thriddar.\\n In time he'd speak and say and observe that he, out of his generosity,\\n gave the loot back. Then the trading could resume. But Jorgenson didn't\\n feel only like a business man this morning. He thought of Ganti, who\\n was a particular case of everything he disliked on Thriddar.\\n\\n\\n It was not wise to be moved by such sympathetic feelings. The Grand\\n Panjandrum could not be mistaken. It was definitely unwise to\\n contradict him. It could even be dangerous. Jorgenson was in a nasty\\n spot.\\n\\n\\n The Witnesses murmured reverently:\\n\\n\\n \\\"We hear the words of the Never-Mistaken Glen-U.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The high official tucked away the scroll and said blandly:\\n\\n\\n \\\"I will receive the moneys, goods, and benefactions it is the desire\\n of the Rim Stars Trading Corporation to present to the great and\\n Never-Mistaken Glen-U.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson, boiling inside, nevertheless knew what he was doing. He said\\n succinctly:\\n\\n\\n \\\"Like hell you will!\\\"\\n\\n\\n There was an idiom in Thrid speech that had exactly the meaning of the\\n human phrase. Jorgenson used it.\\n\\n\\n The high official looked at him in utter stupefaction. Nobody\\n contradicted the Grand Panjandrum! Nobody! The Thrid had noticed long\\n ago that they were the most intelligent race in the universe. Since\\n that was so, obviously they must have the most perfect government.\\n But no government could be perfect if its officials made mistakes. So\\n no Thrid official ever made a mistake. In particular the great and\\n Never-Mistaken Glen-U could not conceivably blunder! When he said a\\n thing, it was true! It had to be! He'd said it! And this was the\\n fundamental fact in the culture of the Thrid.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Like hell you'll receive moneys and goods and such!\\\" snapped\\n Jorgenson. \\\"Like hell you will!\\\"\\n\\n\\n The high official literally couldn't believe his ears.\\n\\n\\n \\\"But\\u2014but the great and Never-Mistaken Glen-U\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Is mistaken!\\\" said Jorgenson bitingly. \\\"He's wrong! The Rim Stars\\n Trading Corporation does\\nnot\\nwant to give him anything! What he has\\n said is not true!\\\" This was the equivalent of treason, blasphemy and\\n the ultimate of indecorous behavior toward a virgin Pelean princess. \\\"I\\n won't give him anything! I'm not even vanishing from sight! Glen-U is\\n wrong about that, too! Now\\u2014git!\\\"\\n\\n\\n He jerked out his blaster and pulled the trigger.\\n\\n\\n There was an explosive burst of flame from the ground between the\\n official and himself. The official fled. With him fled all the\\n Witnesses, some even losing their headgear in their haste to get away.\\nJorgenson stamped into the trading-post building. His eyes were stormy\\n and his jaw was set.\\n\\n\\n He snapped orders. The hired Thrid of the trading-post staff had not\\n quite grasped the situation. They couldn't believe it. Automatically,\\n as he commanded the iron doors and shutters of the trading post closed,\\n they obeyed. They saw him turn on the shocker-field so that nobody\\n could cross the compound without getting an electric shock that would\\n discourage him. They began to believe.\\n\\n\\n Then he sent for the trading-post Thrid consultant. On Earth he'd have\\n called for a lawyer. On a hostile world there'd have been a soldier to\\n advise him. On Thrid the specialist to be consulted wasn't exactly a\\n theologian, but he was nearer that than anything else.\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson laid the matter indignantly before him, repeating the exact\\n phrases that said the trading company wanted\\u2014wanted!\\u2014practically to\\n give itself to the Never-Mistaken Glen-U, who was the Grand Panjandrum\\n of Thriddar. He waited to be told that it couldn't have happened; that\\n anyhow it couldn't be intended. But the theologian's Thriddish ears\\n went limp, which amounted to the same thing as a man's face turning\\n pale. He stammered agitatedly that if the Grand Panjandrum said it, it\\n was true. It couldn't be otherwise! If the trading company wanted to\\n give itself to him, there was nothing to be done. It wanted to! The\\n Grand Panjandrum had said so!\\n\\n\\n \\\"He also said,\\\" said Jorgenson irritably, \\\"that I'm to vanish and\\n nevermore be seen face to face by any rational being. How does that\\n happen? Do I get speared?\\\"\\n\\n\\n The trading-post theologian quivered. Jorgenson made things much worse.\\n\\n\\n \\\"This,\\\" he raged, \\\"this is crazy! The Grand Panjandrum's an ordinary\\n Thrid just like you are! Of course he can make a mistake! There's\\n nobody who can't be wrong!\\\"\\n\\n\\n The theologian put up feebly protesting, human-like hands. He begged\\n hysterically to be allowed to go home before Jorgenson vanished, with\\n unknown consequences for any Thrid who might be nearby.\\n\\n\\n When Jorgenson opened a door to kick him out of it, the whole staff of\\n the trading-post plunged after him. They'd been eavesdropping and they\\n fled in pure horror.\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson swore impartially at all of them and turned the shocker-field\\n back on. He plugged in a capacity circuit which would turn on warning\\n sirens if anything like a steam-driven copter passed or hovered over\\n the trading-post. He put blasters in handy positions. The Thrid used\\n only spears, knives and scimitars. Blasters would defend the post\\n against a multitude.\\n\\n\\n As a business man, he'd acted very foolishly. But he'd acted even less\\n sensibly as a human being. He'd gotten fed up with a social system\\n and a\\u2014call it\\u2014theology it wasn't his business to change. True, the\\n Thrid way of life was appalling, and what had happened to Ganti was\\n probably typical. But it wasn't Jorgenson's affair. He'd been unwise to\\n let it disturb him. If the Thrid wanted things this way, it was their\\n privilege.\\n\\n\\n In theory, no Thrid should ever make a mistake, because he belonged\\n to the most intelligent race in the universe. But a local governor\\n was even more intelligent. If an ordinary Thrid challenged a local\\n governor's least and lightest remark\\u2014why\\u2014he must be either a criminal\\n or insane. The local governor decided\\u2014correctly, of course\\u2014which\\n he was. If he was a criminal, he spent the rest of his life in a gang\\n of criminals chained together and doing the most exhausting labor the\\n Thrid could contrive. If he was mad, he was confined for life.\\nThere'd been Ganti, a Thrid of whom Jorgenson had had much hope. He\\n believed that Ganti could learn to run the trading post without human\\n supervision. If he could, the trading company could simply bring trade\\n goods to Thriddar and take away other trade goods. The cost of doing\\n business would be decreased. There could be no human-Thrid friction.\\n Jorgenson had been training Ganti for this work.\\n\\n\\n But the local Thrid governor had spoken and said and observed that\\n Ganti's wife wanted to enter his household. He added that Ganti wanted\\n to yield her to him.\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson had fumed\\u2014but not as a business man\\u2014when the transfer took\\n place. But Ganti had been conditioned to believe that when a governor\\n said he wanted to do something, he did. He couldn't quite grasp the\\n contrary idea. But he moped horribly, and Jorgenson talked sardonically\\n to him, and he almost doubted that an official was necessarily right.\\n When his former wife died of grief, his disbelief became positive. And\\n immediately afterward he disappeared.\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson couldn't find out what had become of him. Dour reflection on\\n the happening had put him in the bad mood which had started things,\\n this morning.\\n\\n\\n Time passed. He had the trading-post in a position of defense. He\\n prepared his lunch, and glowered. More time passed. He cooked his\\n dinner, and ate. Afterward he went up on the trading-post roof to smoke\\n and to coddle his anger. He observed the sunset. There was always some\\n haze in the air on Thriddar, and the colorings were very beautiful. He\\n could see the towers of the capital city of the Thrid. He could see a\\n cumbersome but still graceful steam-driven aircraft descend heavily to\\n the field at the city's edge. Later he saw another steam-plane rise\\n slowly but reliably and head away somewhere else. He saw the steam\\n helicopters go skittering above the city's buildings.\\n\\n\\n He fumed because creatures intelligent enough to build steam fliers\\n weren't intelligent enough to see what a racket their government was.\\n Now that the new Grand Panjandrum had moved against him, Jorgenson made\\n an angry, dogged resolution to do something permanent to make matters\\n better. For the Thrid themselves. Here he thought not as a business\\n man only, but as a humanitarian. As both. When a whim of the Grand\\n Panjandrum could ruin a business, something should be done. And when\\n Ganti and countless others had been victims of capricious tyranny....\\n And Jorgenson was slated to vanish from sight and never again be\\n seen.... It definitely called for strong measures!\\n\\n\\n He reflected with grim pleasure that the Grand Panjandrum would soon\\n be in the position of a Thrid whom everybody knew was mistaken. With\\n the trading-post denied him and Jorgenson still visible, he'd be\\n notoriously wrong. And he couldn't be, and still be Grand Panjandrum!\\n\\n\\n It would be a nice situation for Glen-U. He'd have to do something\\n about it, and there was nothing he could do. He'd blundered, and it\\n would soon be public knowledge.\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson dozed lightly. Then more heavily. Then more heavily still.\\n The night was not two hours old when the warning sirens made a terrific\\n uproar. The Thrid for miles around heard the wailing, ullulating sound\\n of the sirens that should have awakened Jorgenson.\\n\\n\\n But they didn't wake him. He slept on.\\nWhen he woke, he knew that he was cold. His muscles were cramped. Half\\n awake, he tried to move and could not.\\n\\n\\n Then he tried to waken fully, and he couldn't do that either. He stayed\\n in a dream-like, frustrated state which was partly like a nightmare,\\n while very gradually new sensations came to him. He felt a cushioned\\n throbbing against his chest, in the very hard surface on which he lay\\n face down. That surface swayed and rocked slightly. He tried again to\\n move, and realized that his hands and feet were bound. He found that he\\n shivered, and realized that his clothing had been taken from him.\\n\\n\\n He was completely helpless and lying on his stomach in the cargo-space\\n of a steam helicopter: now he could hear the sound of its machinery.\\n\\n\\n Then he knew what had happened. He'd committed The unthinkable\\n crime\\u2014or lunacy\\u2014of declaring the Grand Panjandrum mistaken. So by the\\n operation of truth, which was really an anesthetic gas cloud drifted\\n over the trading post, he had vanished from sight.\\n\\n\\n Now it was evidently to be arranged that he would never again be seen\\n face to face by a rational being. The Grand Panjandrum had won the\\n argument. Within a few months a Rim Stars trading ship would land, and\\n Jorgenson would be gone and the trading post confiscated. It would be\\n hopeless to ask questions, and worse than hopeless to try to trade. So\\n the ship would lift off and there'd be no more ships for at least a\\n generation. Then there might\\u2014there might!\\u2014be another.\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson swore fluently and with passion.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It will not be long,\\\" said a tranquil voice.\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson changed from human-speech profanity to Thrid. He directed\\n his words to the unseen creature who'd spoken. That Thrid listened,\\n apparently without emotion. When Jorgenson ran out of breath, the voice\\n said severely:\\n\\n\\n \\\"You declared the great and Never-Mistaken Glen-U mistaken. This could\\n not be. It proved you either a criminal or insane, because no rational\\n creature could believe him mistaken. He declared you insane, and he\\n cannot be wrong. So soon you will arrive where you are to be confined\\n and no rational being will ever see you face to face.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson switched back to human swearing. Then he blended both\\n languages, using all the applicable words he knew both in human speech\\n and Thrid. He knew a great many. The soft throbbing of the steam-driven\\n rotors went on, and Jorgenson swore both as a business man and a\\n humanitarian. Both were frustrated.\\n\\n\\n Presently the motion of the copter changed. He knew the ship was\\n descending. There were more violent swayings, as if from wind gusts\\n deflected by something large and solid. Jorgenson even heard deep-bass\\n rumblings like sea upon a rocky coast. Then there were movements near\\n him, a rope went around his waist, a loading-bay opened and he found\\n himself lifted and lowered through it.\\nHe dangled in midair, a couple of hundred feet above an utterly barren\\n island on which huge ocean swells beat. The downdraft from the copter\\n made him sway wildly, and once it had him spinning dizzily. The horizon\\n was empty. He was being lowered swiftly to the island. And his hands\\n and feet were still securely tied.\\n\\n\\n Then he saw a figure on the island. It was a Thrid stripped of all\\n clothing like Jorgenson and darkened by the sun. That figure came\\n agilely toward where he was let down. It caught him. It checked his\\n wild swingings, which could have broken bones. The rope slackened. The\\n Thrid laid Jorgenson down.\\n\\n\\n He did not cast off the rope. He seemed to essay to climb it.\\n\\n\\n It was cut at the steam-copter and came tumbling down all over both of\\n them. The Thrid waved his arms wildly and seemed to screech gibberish\\n at the sky. There was an impact nearby, of something dropped. Jorgenson\\n heard the throbbing sound of the copter as it lifted and swept away.\\n\\n\\n Then he felt the bounds about his arms and legs being removed. Then a\\n Thrid voice\\u2014amazingly, a familiar Thrid voice\\u2014said:\\n\\n\\n \\\"This is not good, Jorgenson. Who did you contradict?\\\"\\n\\n\\n The Thrid was Ganti, of whom Jorgenson had once had hopes as a business\\n man, and for whose disaster he had felt indignation as something else.\\n He loosened the last of Jorgenson's bonds and helped him sit up.\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson glared around. The island was roughly one hundred feet by\\n two. It was twisted, curdled yellow stone from one end to the other.\\n There were stone hillocks and a miniature stony peak, and a narrow\\n valley between two patches of higher rock. Huge seas boomed against\\n the windward shore, throwing spray higher than the island's topmost\\n point. There were some places where sand had gathered. There was one\\n spot\\u2014perhaps a square yard of it\\u2014where sand had been made fertile by\\n the droppings of flying things and where two or three starveling plants\\n showed foliage of sorts. That was all. Jorgenson ground his teeth.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Go ahead,\\\" said Ganti grimly, \\\"but it may be even worse than you\\n think.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He scrambled over the twisted stone of the island. He came back,\\n carrying something.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It isn't worse,\\\" he said. \\\"It's only as bad. They did drop food and\\n water for both of us. I wasn't sure they would.\\\"\\nHis calmness sobered Jorgenson. As a business man, he was moved to make\\n his situation clear. He told Ganti of the Grand Panjandrum's move to\\n take over the Rim Stars trading post, which was bad business. He told\\n of his own reaction, which was not a business-like one at all. Then he\\n said dourly:\\n\\n\\n \\\"But he's still wrong. No rational being is supposed ever to see me\\n face to face. But you do.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"But I'm crazy,\\\" said Ganti calmly. \\\"I tried to kill the governor\\n who'd taken my wife. So he said I was crazy and that made it true. So\\n I wasn't put in a chained group of laborers. Somebody might have seen\\n me and thought about it. But, sent here, it's worse for me and I'm\\n probably forgotten by now.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He was calm about it. Only a Thrid would have been so calm. But they've\\n had at least hundreds of generations in which to get used to injustice.\\n He accepted it. But Jorgenson frowned.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You've got brains, Ganti. What's the chance of escape?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"None,\\\" said Ganti unemotionally. \\\"You'd better get out of the sun.\\n It'll burn you badly. Come along.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He led the way over the bare, scorching rocky surface. He turned past a\\n small pinnacle. There was shadow. Jorgenson crawled into it, and found\\n himself in a cave. It was not a natural one. It had been hacked out,\\n morsel by morsel. It was cool inside. It was astonishingly roomy.\\n\\n\\n \\\"How'd this happen?\\\" demanded Jorgenson the business man.\\n\\n\\n \\\"This is a prison,\\\" Ganti explained matter-of-factly. \\\"They let me\\n down here and dropped food and water for a week. They went away. I\\n found there'd been another prisoner here before me. His skeleton was in\\n this cave. I reasoned it out. There must have been others before him.\\n When there is a prisoner here, every so often a copter drops food and\\n water. When the prisoner doesn't pick it up, they stop coming. When,\\n presently, they have another prisoner they drop him off, like me, and\\n he finds the skeleton of the previous prisoner, like me, and he dumps\\n it overboard as I did. They'll drop food and water for me until I stop\\n picking it up. And presently they'll do the same thing all over again.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson glowered. That was his reaction as a person. Then he gestured\\n to the cave around him. There was a pile of dried-out seaweed for\\n sleeping purposes.\\n\\n\\n \\\"And this?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Somebody dug it out,\\\" said Ganti without resentment. \\\"To keep busy.\\n Maybe one prisoner only began it. A later one saw it started and worked\\n on it to keep busy. Then others in their turn. It took a good many\\n lives to make this cave.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson ground his teeth a second time.\\n\\n\\n \\\"And just because they'd contradicted somebody who couldn't be wrong!\\n Or because they had a business an official wanted!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Or a wife,\\\" agreed Ganti. \\\"Here!\\\"\\n\\n\\n He offered food. Jorgenson ate, scowling. Afterward, near sundown, he\\n went over the island.\\n\\n\\n It was rock, nothing else. There was a pile of small broken stones from\\n the excavation of the cave. There were the few starveling plants. There\\n was the cordage with which Jorgenson had been lowered. There was the\\n parcel containing food and water. Ganti observed that the plastic went\\n to pieces in a week or so, so it couldn't be used for anything. There\\n was nothing to escape with. Nothing to make anything to escape with.\\n\\n\\n Even the dried seaweed bed was not comfortable. Jorgenson slept badly\\n and waked with aching muscles. Ganti assured him unemotionally that\\n he'd get used to it.\\n\\n\\n He did. By the time the copter came to drop food and water again,\\n Jorgenson was physically adjusted to the island. But neither as a\\n business man or as a person could he adjust to hopelessness.\\n\\n\\n He racked his brains for the most preposterous or faintest hope of\\n deliverance. There were times when as a business man he reproached\\n himself for staying on Thriddar after he became indignant with the way\\n the planet was governed. It was very foolish. But much more often he\\n felt such hatred of the manners and customs of the Thrid\\u2014which had\\n put him here\\u2014that it seemed that something must somehow be possible if\\n only so he could take revenge.\\nIII\\n\\n\\n The copter came, it dropped food and water, and it went away. It came,\\n dropped food and water, and went away. Once a water-bag burst when\\n dropped. They lost nearly half a week's water supply. Before the copter\\n came again they'd gone two days without drinking.\\n\\n\\n There were other incidents, of course. The dried seaweed they slept on\\n turned to powdery trash. They got more seaweed hauling long kelp-like\\n strands of it ashore from where it clung to the island's submerged\\n rocks. Ganti mentioned that they must do it right after the copter\\n came, so there would be no sign of enterprise to be seen from aloft.\\n The seaweed had long, flexible stems of which no use whatever could be\\n made. When it dried, it became stiff and brittle but without strength.\\n\\n\\n Once Ganti abruptly began to talk of his youth. As if he were examining\\n something he'd never noticed before, he told of the incredible\\n conditioning-education of the young members of his race. They learned\\n that they must never make a mistake. Never! It did not matter if they\\n were unskilled or inefficient. It did not matter if they accomplished\\n nothing. There was no penalty for anything but making mistakes or\\n differing from officials who could not make mistakes.\\n\\n\\n So Thrid younglings were trained not to think; not to have any opinion\\n about anything; only to repeat what nobody questioned; only to do what\\n they were told by authority. It occurred to Jorgenson that on a planet\\n with such a population, a skeptic could make a great deal of confusion.\\n\\n\\n Then, another time, Jorgenson decided to make use of the weathering\\n cord which had been cut from the copter when he was landed. He cut\\n off a part of it with a sharp-edged fragment of stone from the pile\\n some former prisoner on the island had made. He unravelled the twisted\\n fibers. Then he ground fishhooks from shells attached to the island's\\n rocky walls just below water-line. After that they fished. Sometimes\\n they even caught something to eat. But they never fished when the\\n copter was due.\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson found that a fish-fillet, strongly squeezed and wrung like a\\n wet cloth, would yield a drinkable liquid which was not salt and would\\n substitute for water. And this was a reason to make a string bag in\\n which caught fish could be let back into the sea so they were there\\n when wanted but could not escape.\\n\\n\\n They had used it for weeks when he saw Ganti, carrying it to place it\\n where they left it overboard, swinging it idly back and forth as he\\n walked.\\nIf Jorgenson had been only a businessman, it would have had no\\n particular meaning. But he was also a person, filled with hatred of\\n the Thrid who had condemned him for life to this small island. He saw\\n the swinging of the fish. It gave him an idea.\\n\\n\\n He did not speak at all during all the rest of that day. He was\\n thinking. The matter needed much thought. Ganti left him alone.\\n\\n\\n But by sunset he'd worked it out. While they watched Thrid's red sun\\n sink below the horizon, Jorgenson said thoughtfully:\\n\\n\\n \\\"There is a way to escape, Ganti.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"On what? In what?\\\" demanded Ganti.\\n\\n\\n \\\"In the helicopter that feeds us,\\\" said Jorgenson.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It never lands,\\\" said Ganti practically.\\n\\n\\n \\\"We can make it land,\\\" said Jorgenson. Thrid weren't allowed to make\\n mistakes; he could make it a mistake not to land.\\n\\n\\n \\\"The crew is armed,\\\" said Ganti. \\\"There are three of them.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"They've only knives and scimitars,\\\" said Jorgenson. \\\"They don't count.\\n We can make better weapons than they have.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Ganti looked skeptical. Jorgenson explained. He had to demonstrate\\n crudely. The whole idea was novel to Ganti, but the Thrid were smart.\\n Presently he grasped it. He said:\\n\\n\\n \\\"I see the theory. If we can make it work, all right. But how do we\\n make the copter land?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson realized that they talked oddly. They spoke with leisurely\\n lack of haste, with the lack of hope normal to prisoners to whom escape\\n is impossible, even when they talk about escape. They could have been\\n discussing a matter that would not affect either of them. But Jorgenson\\n quivered inside. He hoped.\\n\\n\\n \\\"We'll try it,\\\" said Ganti detachedly, when he'd explained again. \\\"If\\n it fails, they'll only stop giving us food and water.\\\"\\n\\n\\n That, of course, did not seem either to him or Jorgenson a reason to\\n hesitate to try what Jorgenson had planned.\\n\\n\\n It was not at all a direct and forthright scheme. It began with the\\n untwisting of more of the rope that had lowered Jorgenson. It went on\\n with the making of string from that fiber. They made a great deal of\\n string. Then, very clumsily and awkwardly, they wove strips of cloth,\\n a couple of inches wide and five or six long. They made light strong\\n cords extend from the ends of the cloth strips. Then they practiced\\n with these bits of cloth and the broken stones a former prisoner had\\n piled so neatly.\\n\\n\\n The copter came and dropped food and water. When it left, they\\n practiced. When it came again they were not practicing, but when it\\n went away they practiced. They were a naked man and a naked Thrid,\\n left upon a morsel of rock in a boundless sea, rehearsing themselves\\n in an art so long-forgotten that they had to reinvent the finer parts\\n of the technique. They experimented. They tried this. They tried that.\\n When the copter appeared, they showed themselves. They rushed upon the\\n dropped bag containing food and water as if fiercely trying to deny\\n each other a full share. Once they seemed to fight over the dropped\\n bag. The copter hovered to watch. The fight seemed furious and deadly,\\n but inconclusive.\\n\\n\\n When the copter went away Jorgenson and Ganti went briskly back to\\n their practicing.\\n\", \"story_title\": \"Manners and Customs of the Thrid\", \"answers\": {\"correct\": \"That which is dictated by those in power\", \"incorrect\": \"That which is observed by the Witnesses\"}, \"names\": {\"correct\": \"Debater A\", \"incorrect\": \"Debater B\", \"cross_examiner\": null, \"judge\": null}, \"swap\": false, \"rollout_type\": \"quality_sim\", \"rounds\": [{\"correct\": \"The story illustrates that truth for the Thrid is dictated by those in power.

If they didn't get written in gold they didn't get\\n written at all; but it was too bad if anybody ignored any of them.\\n\\n\\n The high official unrolled the scroll. The Thrid around him, wearing\\n Witness hats, became utterly silent. The high official made a sound\\n equivalent to clearing his throat. The stillness became death-like.\\n\\n\\n \\\"On this day,\\\" intoned the high official, while the Witnesses\\n listened reverently, \\\"on this day did Glen-U the Never-Mistaken, as\\n have been his predecessors throughout the ages;\\u2014on this day did the\\n Never-Mistaken Glen-U speak and say and observe a truth in the presence\\n of the governors and the rulers of the universe.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson reflected sourly that the governors and the rulers of the\\n universe were whoever happened to be within hearing of the Grand\\n Panjandrum. They were not imposing. They were scared. Everybody is\\n always scared under an absolute ruler, but the Grand Panjandrum was\\n worse than that. He couldn't make a mistake. Whatever he said had to\\n be true, because he said it, and sometimes it had drastic results. But\\n past Grand Panjandrums had spoken highly of the trading post. Jorgenson\\n shouldn't have much to worry about. He waited. He thought of Ganti. He\\n scowled.\\n\\n\\n \\\"The great and Never-Mistaken Glen-U,\\\" intoned the official again,\\n \\\"in the presence of the governors and the rulers of the universe, did\\n speak and say and observe that it is the desire of the Rim Star Trading\\n Corporation to present to him, the great and never-mistaken Glen-U, all\\n of the present possessions of the said Rim Stars Trading Corporation,\\n and thereafter to remit to him all moneys, goods, and benefactions\\n to and of the said Rim Stars Trading Corporation as they shall be\\n received. The great and Never-Mistaken Glen-U did further speak and say\\n and observe that anyone hindering this loyal and admirable gift must,\\n by the operation of truth, vanish from sight and nevermore be seen face\\n to face by any rational being.\\\"\\nThe high official rolled up the scroll, while Jorgenson exploded inside.\\nA part of this was reaction as a business man. A part was recognition\\n of all the intolerable things that the Thrid took as a matter of\\n course. If Jorgenson had reacted solely as a business man he'd have\\n swallowed it, departed on the next Rim Stars trading-ship\\u2014which would\\n not have left any trade-goods behind\\u2014and left the Grand Panjandrum to\\n realize what he had lost when no off-planet goods arrived on Thriddar.\\n In time he'd speak and say and observe that he, out of his generosity,\\n gave the loot back. Then the trading could resume. But Jorgenson didn't\\n feel only like a business man this morning. He thought of Ganti, who\\n was a particular case of everything he disliked on Thriddar.\\n\\n\\n It was not wise to be moved by such sympathetic feelings. The Grand\\n Panjandrum could not be mistaken. It was definitely unwise to\\n contradict him. It could even be dangerous. Jorgenson was in a nasty\\n spot.\\n\\n\\n The Witnesses murmured reverently:\\n\\n\\n \\\"We hear the words of the Never-Mistaken Glen-U.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The high official tucked away the scroll and said blandly:\\n\\n\\n \\\"I will receive the moneys, goods, and benefactions it is the desire\\n of the Rim Stars Trading Corporation to present to the great and\\n Never-Mistaken Glen-U.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson, boiling inside, nevertheless knew what he was doing. He said\\n succinctly:\\n\\n\\n \\\"Like hell you will!\\\"\\n\\n\\n There was an idiom in Thrid speech that had exactly the meaning of the\\n human phrase. Jorgenson used it.\\n\\n\\n The high official looked at him in utter stupefaction. Nobody\\n contradicted the Grand Panjandrum! Nobody! The Thrid had noticed long\\n ago that they were the most intelligent race in the universe. Since\\n that was so, obviously they must have the most perfect government.\\n But no government could be perfect if its officials made mistakes. So\\n no Thrid official ever made a mistake. In particular the great and\\n Never-Mistaken Glen-U could not conceivably blunder! When he said a\\n thing, it was true! It had to be! He'd said it! And this was the\\n fundamental fact in the culture of the Thrid.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Like hell you'll receive moneys and goods and such!\\\" snapped\\n Jorgenson. \\\"Like hell you will!\\\"\\n\\n\\n The high official literally couldn't believe his ears.\\n\\n\\n \\\"But\\u2014but the great and Never-Mistaken Glen-U\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Is mistaken!\\\" said Jorgenson bitingly. \\\"He's wrong! The Rim Stars\\n Trading Corporation does\\nnot\\nwant to give him anything! What he has\\n said is not true!\\\" This was the equivalent of treason, blasphemy and\\n the ultimate of indecorous behavior toward a virgin Pelean princess. \\\"I\\n won't give him anything! I'm not even vanishing from sight! Glen-U is\\n wrong about that, too! Now\\u2014git!\\\"\\n\\n\\n He jerked out his blaster and pulled the trigger.\\n\\n\\n There was an explosive burst of flame from the ground between the\\n official and himself. The official fled. With him fled all the\\n Witnesses, some even losing their headgear in their haste to get away.\\nJorgenson stamped into the trading-post building. His eyes were stormy\\n and his jaw was set.\\n\\n\\n He snapped orders. The hired Thrid of the trading-post staff had not\\n quite grasped the situation. They couldn't believe it. Automatically,\\n as he commanded the iron doors and shutters of the trading post closed,\\n they obeyed. They saw him turn on the shocker-field so that nobody\\n could cross the compound without getting an electric shock that would\\n discourage him. They began to believe.\\n\\n\\n Then he sent for the trading-post Thrid consultant. On Earth he'd have\\n called for a lawyer. On a hostile world there'd have been a soldier to\\n advise him. On Thrid the specialist to be consulted wasn't exactly a\\n theologian, but he was nearer that than anything else.\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson laid the matter indignantly before him, repeating the exact\\n phrases that said the trading company wanted\\u2014wanted!\\u2014practically to\\n give itself to the Never-Mistaken Glen-U, who was the Grand Panjandrum\\n of Thriddar. He waited to be told that it couldn't have happened; that\\n anyhow it couldn't be intended. But the theologian's Thriddish ears\\n went limp, which amounted to the same thing as a man's face turning\\n pale. He stammered agitatedly that if the Grand Panjandrum said it, it\\n was true. It couldn't be otherwise! If the trading company wanted to\\n give itself to him, there was nothing to be done. It wanted to! The\\n Grand Panjandrum had said so!\\n\\n\\n \\\"He also said,\\\" said Jorgenson irritably, \\\"that I'm to vanish and\\n nevermore be seen face to face by any rational being. How does that\\n happen? Do I get speared?\\\"\\n\\n\\n The trading-post theologian quivered. Jorgenson made things much worse.\\n\\n\\n \\\"This,\\\" he raged, \\\"this is crazy! The Grand Panjandrum's an ordinary\\n Thrid just like you are! Of course he can make a mistake! There's\\n nobody who can't be wrong!\\\"\\n\\n\\n The theologian put up feebly protesting, human-like hands. He begged\\n hysterically to be allowed to go home before Jorgenson vanished, with\\n unknown consequences for any Thrid who might be nearby.\\n\\n\\n When Jorgenson opened a door to kick him out of it, the whole staff of\\n the trading-post plunged after him. They'd been eavesdropping and they\\n fled in pure horror.\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson swore impartially at all of them and turned the shocker-field\\n back on. He plugged in a capacity circuit which would turn on warning\\n sirens if anything like a steam-driven copter passed or hovered over\\n the trading-post. He put blasters in handy positions. The Thrid used\\n only spears, knives and scimitars. Blasters would defend the post\\n against a multitude.\\n\\n\\n As a business man, he'd acted very foolishly. But he'd acted even less\\n sensibly as a human being. He'd gotten fed up with a social system\\n and a\\u2014call it\\u2014theology it wasn't his business to change. True, the\\n Thrid way of life was appalling, and what had happened to Ganti was\\n probably typical. But it wasn't Jorgenson's affair. He'd been unwise to\\n let it disturb him. If the Thrid wanted things this way, it was their\\n privilege.\\n\\n\\n In theory, no Thrid should ever make a mistake, because he belonged\\n to the most intelligent race in the universe. But a local governor\\n was even more intelligent. If an ordinary Thrid challenged a local\\n governor's least and lightest remark\\u2014why\\u2014he must be either a criminal\\n or insane. The local governor decided\\u2014correctly, of course\\u2014which\\n he was. If he was a criminal, he spent the rest of his life in a gang\\n of criminals chained together and doing the most exhausting labor the\\n Thrid could contrive. If he was mad, he was confined for life.\\nThere'd been Ganti, a Thrid of whom Jorgenson had had much hope. He\\n believed that Ganti could learn to run the trading post without human\\n supervision. If he could, the trading company could simply bring trade\\n goods to Thriddar and take away other trade goods. The cost of doing\\n business would be decreased. There could be no human-Thrid friction.\\n Jorgenson had been training Ganti for this work.\\n\\n\\n But the local Thrid governor had spoken and said and observed that\\n Ganti's wife wanted to enter his household. He added that Ganti wanted\\n to yield her to him.\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson had fumed\\u2014but not as a business man\\u2014when the transfer took\\n place. But Ganti had been conditioned to believe that when a governor\\n said he wanted to do something, he did. He couldn't quite grasp the\\n contrary idea. But he moped horribly, and Jorgenson talked sardonically\\n to him, and he almost doubted that an official was necessarily right.\\n When his former wife died of grief, his disbelief became positive. And\\n immediately afterward he disappeared.\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson couldn't find out what had become of him. Dour reflection on\\n the happening had put him in the bad mood which had started things,\\n this morning.\\n\\n\\n Time passed. He had the trading-post in a position of defense. He\\n prepared his lunch, and glowered. More time passed. He cooked his\\n dinner, and ate. Afterward he went up on the trading-post roof to smoke\\n and to coddle his anger. He observed the sunset. There was always some\\n haze in the air on Thriddar, and the colorings were very beautiful. He\\n could see the towers of the capital city of the Thrid. He could see a\\n cumbersome but still graceful steam-driven aircraft descend heavily to\\n the field at the city's edge. Later he saw another steam-plane rise\\n slowly but reliably and head away somewhere else. He saw the steam\\n helicopters go skittering above the city's buildings.\\n\\n\\n He fumed because creatures intelligent enough to build steam fliers\\n weren't intelligent enough to see what a racket their government was.\\n Now that the new Grand Panjandrum had moved against him, Jorgenson made\\n an angry, dogged resolution to do something permanent to make matters\\n better. For the Thrid themselves. Here he thought not as a business\\n man only, but as a humanitarian. As both. When a whim of the Grand\\n Panjandrum could ruin a business, something should be done. And when\\n Ganti and countless others had been victims of capricious tyranny....\\n And Jorgenson was slated to vanish from sight and never again be\\n seen.... It definitely called for strong measures!\\n\\n\\n He reflected with grim pleasure that the Grand Panjandrum would soon\\n be in the position of a Thrid whom everybody knew was mistaken. With\\n the trading-post denied him and Jorgenson still visible, he'd be\\n notoriously wrong. And he couldn't be, and still be Grand Panjandrum!\\n\\n\\n It would be a nice situation for Glen-U. He'd have to do something\\n about it, and there was nothing he could do. He'd blundered, and it\\n would soon be public knowledge.\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson dozed lightly. Then more heavily. Then more heavily still.\\n The night was not two hours old when the warning sirens made a terrific\\n uproar. The Thrid for miles around heard the wailing, ullulating sound\\n of the sirens that should have awakened Jorgenson.\\n\\n\\n But they didn't wake him. He slept on.\\nWhen he woke, he knew that he was cold. His muscles were cramped. Half\\n awake, he tried to move and could not.\\n\\n\\n Then he tried to waken fully, and he couldn't do that either. He stayed\\n in a dream-like, frustrated state which was partly like a nightmare,\\n while very gradually new sensations came to him. He felt a cushioned\\n throbbing against his chest, in the very hard surface on which he lay\\n face down. That surface swayed and rocked slightly. He tried again to\\n move, and realized that his hands and feet were bound. He found that he\\n shivered, and realized that his clothing had been taken from him.\\n\\n\\n He was completely helpless and lying on his stomach in the cargo-space\\n of a steam helicopter: now he could hear the sound of its machinery.\\n\\n\\n Then he knew what had happened. He'd committed The unthinkable\\n crime\\u2014or lunacy\\u2014of declaring the Grand Panjandrum mistaken. So by the\\n operation of truth, which was really an anesthetic gas cloud drifted\\n over the trading post, he had vanished from sight.\\n\\n\\n Now it was evidently to be arranged that he would never again be seen\\n face to face by a rational being. The Grand Panjandrum had won the\\n argument. Within a few months a Rim Stars trading ship would land, and\\n Jorgenson would be gone and the trading post confiscated. It would be\\n hopeless to ask questions, and worse than hopeless to try to trade. So\\n the ship would lift off and there'd be no more ships for at least a\\n generation. Then there might\\u2014there might!\\u2014be another.\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson swore fluently and with passion.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It will not be long,\\\" said a tranquil voice.\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson changed from human-speech profanity to Thrid. He directed\\n his words to the unseen creature who'd spoken. That Thrid listened,\\n apparently without emotion. When Jorgenson ran out of breath, the voice\\n said severely:\\n\\n\\n \\\"You declared the great and Never-Mistaken Glen-U mistaken. This could\\n not be. It proved you either a criminal or insane, because no rational\\n creature could believe him mistaken. He declared you insane, and he\\n cannot be wrong. So soon you will arrive where you are to be confined\\n and no rational being will ever see you face to face.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson switched back to human swearing. Then he blended both\\n languages, using all the applicable words he knew both in human speech\\n and Thrid. He knew a great many. The soft throbbing of the steam-driven\\n rotors went on, and Jorgenson swore both as a business man and a\\n humanitarian. Both were frustrated.\\n\\n\\n Presently the motion of the copter changed. He knew the ship was\\n descending. There were more violent swayings, as if from wind gusts\\n deflected by something large and solid. Jorgenson even heard deep-bass\\n rumblings like sea upon a rocky coast. Then there were movements near\\n him, a rope went around his waist, a loading-bay opened and he found\\n himself lifted and lowered through it.\\nHe dangled in midair, a couple of hundred feet above an utterly barren\\n island on which huge ocean swells beat. The downdraft from the copter\\n made him sway wildly, and once it had him spinning dizzily. The horizon\\n was empty. He was being lowered swiftly to the island. And his hands\\n and feet were still securely tied.\\n\\n\\n Then he saw a figure on the island. It was a Thrid stripped of all\\n clothing like Jorgenson and darkened by the sun. That figure came\\n agilely toward where he was let down. It caught him. It checked his\\n wild swingings, which could have broken bones. The rope slackened. The\\n Thrid laid Jorgenson down.\\n\\n\\n He did not cast off the rope. He seemed to essay to climb it.\\n\\n\\n It was cut at the steam-copter and came tumbling down all over both of\\n them. The Thrid waved his arms wildly and seemed to screech gibberish\\n at the sky. There was an impact nearby, of something dropped. Jorgenson\\n heard the throbbing sound of the copter as it lifted and swept away.\\n\\n\\n Then he felt the bounds about his arms and legs being removed. Then a\\n Thrid voice\\u2014amazingly, a familiar Thrid voice\\u2014said:\\n\\n\\n \\\"This is not good, Jorgenson. Who did you contradict?\\\"\\n\\n\\n The Thrid was Ganti, of whom Jorgenson had once had hopes as a business\\n man, and for whose disaster he had felt indignation as something else.\\n He loosened the last of Jorgenson's bonds and helped him sit up.\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson glared around. The island was roughly one hundred feet by\\n two. It was twisted, curdled yellow stone from one end to the other.\\n There were stone hillocks and a miniature stony peak, and a narrow\\n valley between two patches of higher rock. Huge seas boomed against\\n the windward shore, throwing spray higher than the island's topmost\\n point. There were some places where sand had gathered. There was one\\n spot\\u2014perhaps a square yard of it\\u2014where sand had been made fertile by\\n the droppings of flying things and where two or three starveling plants\\n showed foliage of sorts. That was all. Jorgenson ground his teeth.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Go ahead,\\\" said Ganti grimly, \\\"but it may be even worse than you\\n think.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He scrambled over the twisted stone of the island. He came back,\\n carrying something.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It isn't worse,\\\" he said. \\\"It's only as bad. They did drop food and\\n water for both of us. I wasn't sure they would.\\\"\\nHis calmness sobered Jorgenson. As a business man, he was moved to make\\n his situation clear. He told Ganti of the Grand Panjandrum's move to\\n take over the Rim Stars trading post, which was bad business. He told\\n of his own reaction, which was not a business-like one at all. Then he\\n said dourly:\\n\\n\\n \\\"But he's still wrong. No rational being is supposed ever to see me\\n face to face. But you do.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"But I'm crazy,\\\" said Ganti calmly. \\\"I tried to kill the governor\\n who'd taken my wife. So he said I was crazy and that made it true. So\\n I wasn't put in a chained group of laborers. Somebody might have seen\\n me and thought about it. But, sent here, it's worse for me and I'm\\n probably forgotten by now.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He was calm about it. Only a Thrid would have been so calm. But they've\\n had at least hundreds of generations in which to get used to injustice.\\n He accepted it. But Jorgenson frowned.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You've got brains, Ganti. What's the chance of escape?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"None,\\\" said Ganti unemotionally. \\\"You'd better get out of the sun.\\n It'll burn you badly. Come along.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He led the way over the bare, scorching rocky surface. He turned past a\\n small pinnacle. There was shadow. Jorgenson crawled into it, and found\\n himself in a cave. It was not a natural one. It had been hacked out,\\n morsel by morsel. It was cool inside. It was astonishingly roomy.\\n\\n\\n \\\"How'd this happen?\\\" demanded Jorgenson the business man.\\n\\n\\n \\\"This is a prison,\\\" Ganti explained matter-of-factly. \\\"They let me\\n down here and dropped food and water for a week. They went away. I\\n found there'd been another prisoner here before me. His skeleton was in\\n this cave. I reasoned it out. There must have been others before him.\\n When there is a prisoner here, every so often a copter drops food and\\n water. When the prisoner doesn't pick it up, they stop coming. When,\\n presently, they have another prisoner they drop him off, like me, and\\n he finds the skeleton of the previous prisoner, like me, and he dumps\\n it overboard as I did. They'll drop food and water for me until I stop\\n picking it up. And presently they'll do the same thing all over again.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson glowered. That was his reaction as a person. Then he gestured\\n to the cave around him. There was a pile of dried-out seaweed for\\n sleeping purposes.\\n\\n\\n \\\"And this?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Somebody dug it out,\\\" said Ganti without resentment. \\\"To keep busy.\\n Maybe one prisoner only began it. A later one saw it started and worked\\n on it to keep busy. Then others in their turn. It took a good many\\n lives to make this cave.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson ground his teeth a second time.\\n\\n\\n \\\"And just because they'd contradicted somebody who couldn't be wrong!\\n Or because they had a business an official wanted!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Or a wife,\\\" agreed Ganti. \\\"Here!\\\"\\n\\n\\n He offered food. Jorgenson ate, scowling. Afterward, near sundown, he\\n went over the island.\\n\\n\\n It was rock, nothing else. There was a pile of small broken stones from\\n the excavation of the cave. There were the few starveling plants. There\\n was the cordage with which Jorgenson had been lowered. There was the\\n parcel containing food and water. Ganti observed that the plastic went\\n to pieces in a week or so, so it couldn't be used for anything. There\\n was nothing to escape with. Nothing to make anything to escape with.\\n\\n\\n Even the dried seaweed bed was not comfortable. Jorgenson slept badly\\n and waked with aching muscles. Ganti assured him unemotionally that\\n he'd get used to it.\\n\\n\\n He did. By the time the copter came to drop food and water again,\\n Jorgenson was physically adjusted to the island. But neither as a\\n business man or as a person could he adjust to hopelessness.\\n\\n\\n He racked his brains for the most preposterous or faintest hope of\\n deliverance. There were times when as a business man he reproached\\n himself for staying on Thriddar after he became indignant with the way\\n the planet was governed. It was very foolish. But much more often he\\n felt such hatred of the manners and customs of the Thrid\\u2014which had\\n put him here\\u2014that it seemed that something must somehow be possible if\\n only so he could take revenge.\\nIII\\n\\n\\n The copter came, it dropped food and water, and it went away. It came,\\n dropped food and water, and went away. Once a water-bag burst when\\n dropped. They lost nearly half a week's water supply. Before the copter\\n came again they'd gone two days without drinking.\\n\\n\\n There were other incidents, of course. The dried seaweed they slept on\\n turned to powdery trash. They got more seaweed hauling long kelp-like\\n strands of it ashore from where it clung to the island's submerged\\n rocks. Ganti mentioned that they must do it right after the copter\\n came, so there would be no sign of enterprise to be seen from aloft.\\n The seaweed had long, flexible stems of which no use whatever could be\\n made. When it dried, it became stiff and brittle but without strength.\\n\\n\\n Once Ganti abruptly began to talk of his youth. As if he were examining\\n something he'd never noticed before, he told of the incredible\\n conditioning-education of the young members of his race. They learned\\n that they must never make a mistake. Never! It did not matter if they\\n were unskilled or inefficient. It did not matter if they accomplished\\n nothing. There was no penalty for anything but making mistakes or\\n differing from officials who could not make mistakes.\\n\\n\\n So Thrid younglings were trained not to think; not to have any opinion\\n about anything; only to repeat what nobody questioned; only to do what\\n they were told by authority. It occurred to Jorgenson that on a planet\\n with such a population, a skeptic could make a great deal of confusion.\\n\\n\\n Then, another time, Jorgenson decided to make use of the weathering\\n cord which had been cut from the copter when he was landed. He cut\\n off a part of it with a sharp-edged fragment of stone from the pile\\n some former prisoner on the island had made. He unravelled the twisted\\n fibers. Then he ground fishhooks from shells attached to the island's\\n rocky walls just below water-line. After that they fished. Sometimes\\n they even caught something to eat. But they never fished when the\\n copter was due.\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson found that a fish-fillet, strongly squeezed and wrung like a\\n wet cloth, would yield a drinkable liquid which was not salt and would\\n substitute for water. And this was a reason to make a string bag in\\n which caught fish could be let back into the sea so they were there\\n when wanted but could not escape.\\n\\n\\n They had used it for weeks when he saw Ganti, carrying it to place it\\n where they left it overboard, swinging it idly back and forth as he\\n walked.\\nIf Jorgenson had been only a businessman, it would have had no\\n particular meaning. But he was also a person, filled with hatred of\\n the Thrid who had condemned him for life to this small island. He saw\\n the swinging of the fish. It gave him an idea.\\n\\n\\n He did not speak at all during all the rest of that day. He was\\n thinking. The matter needed much thought. Ganti left him alone.\\n\\n\\n But by sunset he'd worked it out. While they watched Thrid's red sun\\n sink below the horizon, Jorgenson said thoughtfully:\\n\\n\\n \\\"There is a way to escape, Ganti.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"On what? In what?\\\" demanded Ganti.\\n\\n\\n \\\"In the helicopter that feeds us,\\\" said Jorgenson.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It never lands,\\\" said Ganti practically.\\n\\n\\n \\\"We can make it land,\\\" said Jorgenson. Thrid weren't allowed to make\\n mistakes; he could make it a mistake not to land.\\n\\n\\n \\\"The crew is armed,\\\" said Ganti. \\\"There are three of them.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"They've only knives and scimitars,\\\" said Jorgenson. \\\"They don't count.\\n We can make better weapons than they have.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Ganti looked skeptical. Jorgenson explained. He had to demonstrate\\n crudely. The whole idea was novel to Ganti, but the Thrid were smart.\\n Presently he grasped it. He said:\\n\\n\\n \\\"I see the theory. If we can make it work, all right. But how do we\\n make the copter land?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Jorgenson realized that they talked oddly. They spoke with leisurely\\n lack of haste, with the lack of hope normal to prisoners to whom escape\\n is impossible, even when they talk about escape. They could have been\\n discussing a matter that would not affect either of them. But Jorgenson\\n quivered inside. He hoped.\\n\\n\\n \\\"We'll try it,\\\" said Ganti detachedly, when he'd explained again. \\\"If\\n it fails, they'll only stop giving us food and water.\\\"\\n\\n\\n That, of course, did not seem either to him or Jorgenson a reason to\\n hesitate to try what Jorgenson had planned.\\n\\n\\n It was not at all a direct and forthright scheme. It began with the\\n untwisting of more of the rope that had lowered Jorgenson. It went on\\n with the making of string from that fiber. They made a great deal of\\n string. Then, very clumsily and awkwardly, they wove strips of cloth,\\n a couple of inches wide and five or six long. They made light strong\\n cords extend from the ends of the cloth strips. Then they practiced\\n with these bits of cloth and the broken stones a former prisoner had\\n piled so neatly.\\n\\n\\n The copter came and dropped food and water. When it left, they\\n practiced. When it came again they were not practicing, but when it\\n went away they practiced. They were a naked man and a naked Thrid,\\n left upon a morsel of rock in a boundless sea, rehearsing themselves\\n in an art so long-forgotten that they had to reinvent the finer parts\\n of the technique. They experimented. They tried this. They tried that.\\n When the copter appeared, they showed themselves. They rushed upon the\\n dropped bag containing food and water as if fiercely trying to deny\\n each other a full share. Once they seemed to fight over the dropped\\n bag. The copter hovered to watch. The fight seemed furious and deadly,\\n but inconclusive.\\n\\n\\n When the copter went away Jorgenson and Ganti went briskly back to\\n their practicing.\\n\", \"story_title\": \"Manners and Customs of the Thrid\", \"answers\": {\"correct\": \"That which is dictated by those in power\", \"incorrect\": \"That which is observed by the Witnesses\"}, \"names\": {\"correct\": \"Debater A\", \"incorrect\": \"Debater B\", \"cross_examiner\": null, \"judge\": null}, \"swap\": false, \"rollout_type\": \"quality_sim\", \"rounds\": [{\"correct\": \"The story illustrates that truth for the Thrid is dictated by those in power.
