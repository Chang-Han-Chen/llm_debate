And then I was awake\\u2014and the fire was still there, fiercely\\n burning at me.\\n\\n\\n I tried to move to get away from the flames, and then the real pain\\n hit me. I tried to go back to sleep and the relative comfort of the\\n river of fire, but it was no go. For better or worse, I was alive and\\n conscious.\\n\\n\\n I opened my eyes and took a look around. I was on the floor next to\\n an unpadded acceleration couch\\u2014the kind the Terrestrial Space Arm\\n installs in seldom-used lifeboats. There were three more couches, but\\n no one in them. I tried to sit up. It wasn't easy but, by applying a\\n lot more will-power than should be required of a sick man, I made it.\\n I took a look at my left arm. Baked. The hand was only medium rare,\\n but the forearm was black, with deep red showing at the bottom of the\\n cracks where the crisped upper layers had burst....\\n\\n\\n There was a first-aid cabinet across the compartment from me. I\\n tried my right leg, felt broken bone-ends grate with a sensation\\n that transcended pain. I heaved with the other leg, scrabbled with\\n the charred arm. The crawl to the cabinet dwarfed Hillary's trek\\n up Everest, but I reached it after a couple of years, and found the\\n microswitch on the floor that activated the thing, and then I was\\n fading out again....\\nI came out of it clear-headed but weak. My right leg was numb, but\\n reasonably comfortable, clamped tight in a walking brace. I put up\\n a hand and felt a shaved skull, with sutures. It must have been a\\n fracture. The left arm\\u2014well, it was still there, wrapped to the\\n shoulder and held out stiffly by a power truss that would keep the scar\\n tissue from pulling up and crippling me. The steady pressure as the\\n truss contracted wasn't anything to do a sense-tape on for replaying at\\n leisure moments, but at least the cabinet hadn't amputated. I wasn't\\n complaining.\\n\\n\\n As far as I knew, I was the first recorded survivor of contact with the\\n Gool\\u2014if I survived.\\n\\n\\n I was still a long way from home, and I hadn't yet checked on the\\n condition of the lifeboat. I glanced toward the entry port. It was\\n dogged shut. I could see black marks where my burned hand had been at\\n work.\\n\\n\\n I fumbled my way into a couch and tried to think. In my condition\\u2014with\\n a broken leg and third-degree burns, plus a fractured skull\\u2014I\\n shouldn't have been able to fall out of bed, much less make the trip\\n from\\nBelshazzar's\\nCCC to the boat; and how had I managed to dog that\\n port shut? In an emergency a man was capable of great exertions. But\\n running on a broken femur, handling heavy levers with charred fingers\\n and thinking with a cracked head were overdoing it. Still, I was\\n here\\u2014and it was time to get a call through to TSA headquarters.\\n\\n\\n I flipped the switch and gave the emergency call-letters Col. Ausar\\n Kayle of Aerospace Intelligence had assigned to me a few weeks before.\\n It was almost five minutes before the \\\"acknowledge\\\" came through from\\n the Ganymede relay station, another ten minutes before Kayle's face\\n swam into view. Even through the blur of the screen I could see the\\n haggard look.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Granthan!\\\" he burst out. \\\"Where are the others? What happened out\\n there?\\\" I turned him down to a mutter.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Hold on,\\\" I said. \\\"I'll tell you. Recorders going?\\\" I didn't wait for\\n an answer\\u2014not with a fifteen-minute transmission lag. I plowed on:\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nBelshazzar\\nwas sabotaged. So was\\nGilgamesh\\n\\u2014I think. I got out. I\\n lost a little skin, but the aid cabinet has the case in hand. Tell the\\n Med people the drinks are on me.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I finished talking and flopped back, waiting for Kayle's reply. On the\\n screen, his flickering image gazed back impatiently, looking as hostile\\n as a swing-shift ward nurse. It would be half an hour before I would\\n get his reaction to my report. I dozed off\\u2014and awoke with a start.\\n Kayle was talking.\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\u2014your report. I won't mince words. They're wondering at your role in\\n the disaster. How does it happen that you alone survived?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"How the hell do I know?\\\" I yelled\\u2014or croaked. But Kayle's voice was\\n droning on:\\n\\n\\n \\\"... you Psychodynamics people have been telling me the Gool may\\n have some kind of long-range telehypnotic ability that might make it\\n possible for them to subvert a loyal man without his knowledge. You've\\n told me yourself that you blacked out during the attack\\u2014and came to on\\n the lifeboat, with no recollection of how you got there.\\n\\n\\n \\\"This is war, Granthan. War against a vicious enemy who strike without\\n warning and without mercy. You were sent out to investigate the\\n possibility of\\u2014what's that term you use?\\u2014hyper-cortical invasion. You\\n know better than most the risk I'd be running if you were allowed to\\n pass the patrol line.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'm sorry, Granthan. I can't let you land on Earth. I can't accept\\n the risk.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"What do I do now?\\\" I stormed. \\\"Go into orbit and eat pills and hope\\n you think of something? I need a doctor!\\\"\\n\\n\\n Presently Kayle replied. \\\"Yes,\\\" he said. \\\"You'll have to enter a\\n parking orbit. Perhaps there will be developments soon which will make\\n it possible to ... ah ... restudy the situation.\\\" He didn't meet my\\n eye. I knew what he was thinking. He'd spare me the mental anguish of\\n knowing what was coming. I couldn't really blame him; he was doing\\n what he thought was the right thing. And I'd have to go along and\\n pretend\\u2014right up until the warheads struck\\u2014that I didn't know I'd\\n been condemned to death.\\nII\\n\\n\\n I tried to gather my wits and think my way through the situation. I\\n was alone and injured, aboard a lifeboat that would be the focus of a\\n converging flight of missiles as soon as I approached within battery\\n range of Earth. I had gotten clear of the Gool, but I wouldn't survive\\n my next meeting with my own kind. They couldn't take the chance that I\\n was acting under Gool orders.\\n\\n\\n I wasn't, of course. I was still the same Peter Granthan,\\n psychodynamicist, who had started out with Dayan's fleet six weeks\\n earlier. The thoughts I was having weren't brilliant, but they were\\n mine, all mine....\\n\\n\\n But how could I be sure of that?\\n\\n\\n Maybe there was something in Kayle's suspicion. If the Gool were as\\n skillful as we thought, they would have left no overt indications of\\n their tampering\\u2014not at a conscious level.\\n\\n\\n But this was where psychodynamics training came in. I had been reacting\\n like any scared casualty, aching to get home and lick his wounds. But I\\n wasn't just any casualty. I had been trained in the subtleties of the\\n mind\\u2014and I had been prepared for just such an attack.\\n\\n\\n Now was the time to make use of that training. It had given me one\\n resource. I could unlock the memories of my subconscious\\u2014and see again\\n what had happened.\\n\\n\\n I lay back, cleared my mind of extraneous thoughts, and concentrated on\\n the trigger word that would key an auto-hypnotic sequence....\\n\\n\\n Sense impressions faded. I was alone in the nebulous emptiness of a\\n first-level trance. I keyed a second word, slipped below the misty\\n surface into a dreamworld of vague phantasmagoric figures milling in\\n their limbo of sub-conceptualization. I penetrated deeper, broke\\n through into the vividly hallucinatory third level, where images of\\n mirror-bright immediacy clamored for attention. And deeper....\\nThe immense orderly confusion of the basic memory level lay before\\n me. Abstracted from it, aloof and observant, the monitoring\\n personality-fraction scanned the pattern, searching the polydimensional\\n continuum for evidence of an alien intrusion.\\n\\n\\n And found it.\\n\\n\\n As the eye instantaneously detects a flicker of motion amid an infinity\\n of static detail, so my inner eye perceived the subtle traces of the\\n probing Gool mind, like a whispered touch deftly rearranging my buried\\n motivations.\\n\\n\\n I focused selectively, tuned to the recorded gestalt.\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nIt is a contact, Effulgent One!\\n\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nSoftly, now! Nurture the spark well. It but trembles at the\\n threshold....\\n\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nIt is elusive, Master! It wriggles like a gorm-worm in the eating\\n trough!\\n\\\"\\n\\n\\n A part of my mind watched as the memory unreeled. I listened to the\\n voices\\u2014yet not voices, merely the shape of concepts, indescribably\\n intricate. I saw how the decoy pseudo-personality which I had\\n concretized for the purpose in a hundred training sessions had fought\\n against the intruding stimuli\\u2014then yielded under the relentless thrust\\n of the alien probe. I watched as the Gool operator took over the motor\\n centers, caused me to crawl through the choking smoke of the devastated\\n control compartment toward the escape hatch. Fire leaped up, blocking\\n the way. I went on, felt ghostly flames whipping at me\\u2014and then the\\n hatch was open and I pulled myself through, forcing the broken leg.\\n My blackened hand fumbled at the locking wheel. Then the blast as\\n the lifeboat leaped clear of the disintegrating dreadnought\\u2014and the\\n world-ending impact as I fell.\\n\\n\\n At a level far below the conscious, the embattled pseudo-personality\\n lashed out again\\u2014fighting the invader.\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nAlmost it eluded me then, Effulgent Lord. Link with this lowly one!\\n\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nImpossible! Do you forget all my teachings? Cling, though you expend\\n the last filament of your life-force!\\n\\\"\\n\\n\\n Free from all distraction, at a level where comprehension and retention\\n are instantaneous and total, my monitoring basic personality fraction\\n followed the skillful Gool mind as it engraved its commands deep in\\n my subconscious. Then the touch withdrew, erasing the scars of its\\n passage, to leave me unaware of its tampering\\u2014at a conscious level.\\n\\n\\n Watching the Gool mind, I learned.\\n\\n\\n The insinuating probe\\u2014a concept regarding which psychodynamicists had\\n theorized\\u2014was no more than a pattern in emptiness....\\n\\n\\n But a pattern which I could duplicate, now that I had seen what had\\n been done to me.\\n\\n\\n Hesitantly, I felt for the immaterial fabric of the continuum, warping\\n and manipulating it, copying the Gool probe. Like planes of paper-thin\\n crystal, the polyfinite aspects of reality shifted into focus, aligning\\n themselves.\\n\\n\\n Abruptly, a channel lay open. As easily as I would stretch out my hand\\n to pluck a moth from a night-flower, I reached across the unimaginable\\n void\\u2014and sensed a pit blacker than the bottom floor of hell, and a\\n glistening dark shape.\\n\\n\\n There was a soundless shriek. \\\"\\nEffulgence! It reached out\\u2014touched\\n me!\\n\\\"\\nUsing the technique I had grasped from the Gool itself, I struck,\\n stifling the outcry, invaded the fetid blackness and grappled the\\n obscene gelatinous immensity of the Gool spy as it spasmed in a frenzy\\n of xenophobia\\u2014a ton of liver writhing at the bottom of a dark well.\\n\\n\\n I clamped down control. The Gool mind folded in on itself, gibbering.\\n Not pausing to rest, I followed up, probed along my channel of contact,\\n tracing patterns, scanning the flaccid Gool mind....\\n\\n\\n I saw a world of yellow seas lapping at endless shores of mud. There\\n was a fuming pit, where liquid sulphur bubbled up from some inner\\n source, filling an immense natural basin. The Gool clustered at its\\n rim, feeding, each monstrous shape heaving against its neighbors for a\\n more favorable position.\\nI probed farther, saw the great cables of living nervous tissue that\\n linked each eating organ with the brain-mass far underground. I traced\\n the passages through which tendrils ran out to immense caverns where\\n smaller creatures labored over strange devices. These, my host's memory\\n told me, were the young of the Gool. Here they built the fleets that\\n would transport the spawn to the new worlds the Prime Overlord had\\n discovered, worlds where food was free for the taking. Not sulphur\\n alone, but potassium, calcium, iron and all the metals\\u2014riches\\n beyond belief in endless profusion. No longer would the Gool tribe\\n cluster\\u2014those who remained of a once-great race\\u2014at a single feeding\\n trough. They would spread out across a galaxy\\u2014and beyond.\\n\\n\\n But not if I could help it.\\n\\n\\n The Gool had evolved a plan\\u2014but they'd had a stroke of bad luck.\\n\\n\\n In the past, they had managed to control a man here and there, among\\n the fleets, far from home, but only at a superficial level. Enough,\\n perhaps, to wreck a ship, but not the complete control needed to send a\\n man back to Earth under Gool compulsion, to carry out complex sabotage.\\n\\n\\n Then they had found me, alone, a sole survivor, free from the clutter\\n of the other mind-fields. It had been their misfortune to pick a\\n psychodynamicist. Instead of gaining a patient slave, they had opened\\n the fortress door to an unseen spy. Now that I was there, I would see\\n what I could steal.\\n\\n\\n A timeless time passed. I wandered among patterns of white light and\\n white sound, plumbed the deepest recesses of hidden Gool thoughts,\\n fared along strange ways examining the shapes and colors of the\\n concepts of an alien mind.\\n\\n\\n I paused at last, scanning a multi-ordinal structure of pattern within\\n pattern; the diagrammed circuits of a strange machine.\\n\\n\\n I followed through its logic-sequence; and, like a bomb-burst, its\\n meaning exploded in my mind.\\n\\n\\n From the vile nest deep under the dark surface of the Gool world in\\n its lonely trans-Plutonian orbit, I had plucked the ultimate secret of\\n their kind.\\n\\n\\n Matter across space.\\n\\\"You've got to listen to me, Kayle,\\\" I shouted. \\\"I know you think I'm\\n a Gool robot. But what I have is too big to let you blow it up without\\n a fight. Matter transmission! You know what that can mean to us. The\\n concept is too complex to try to describe in words. You'll have to take\\n my word for it. I can build it, though, using standard components, plus\\n an infinite-area antenna and a moebius-wound coil\\u2014and a few other\\n things....\\\"\\n\\n\\n I harangued Kayle for a while, and then sweated out his answer. I was\\n getting close now. If he couldn't see the beauty of my proposal, my\\n screens would start to register the radiation of warheads any time now.\\n\\n\\n Kayle came back\\u2014and his answer boiled down to \\\"no.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I tried to reason with him. I reminded him how I had readied myself\\n for the trip with sessions on the encephaloscope, setting up the\\n cross-networks of conditioned defensive responses, the shunt circuits\\n to the decoy pseudo-personality, leaving my volitional ego free. I\\n talked about subliminal hypnotics and the resilience quotient of the\\n ego-complex.\\n\\n\\n I might have saved my breath.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I don't understand that psychodynamics jargon, Granthan,\\\" he snapped.\\n \\\"It smacks of mysticism. But I understand what the Gool have done to\\n you well enough. I'm sorry.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I leaned back and chewed the inside of my lip and thought unkind\\n thoughts about Colonel Ausar Kayle. Then I settled down to solve the\\n problem at hand.\\n\\n\\n I keyed the chart file, flashed pages from the standard index on the\\n reference screen, checking radar coverages, beacon ranges, monitor\\n stations, controller fields. It looked as though a radar-negative boat\\n the size of mine might possibly get through the defensive net with a\\n daring pilot, and as a condemned spy, I could afford to be daring.\\n\\n\\n And I had a few ideas.\\nIII\\n\\n\\n The shrilling of the proximity alarm blasted through the silence. For a\\n wild moment I thought Kayle had beaten me to the punch; then I realized\\n it was the routine DEW line patrol contact.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Z four-oh-two, I am reading your IFF. Decelerate at 1.8 gee\\n preparatory to picking up approach orbit....\\\"\\n\\n\\n The screen went on droning out instructions. I fed them into the\\n autopilot, at the same time running over my approach plan. The scout\\n was moving in closer. I licked dry lips. It was time to try.\\n\\n\\n I closed my eyes, reached out\\u2014as the Gool mind had reached out to\\n me\\u2014and felt the touch of a Signals Officer's mind, forty thousand\\n miles distant, aboard the patrol vessel. There was a brief flurry of\\n struggle; then I dictated my instructions. The Signals Officer punched\\n keys, spoke into his microphone:\\n\\n\\n \\\"As you were, Z four-oh-two. Continue on present course. At Oh-nineteen\\n seconds, pick up planetary for re-entry and let-down.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I blanked out the man's recollection of what had happened, caught his\\n belated puzzlement as I broke contact. But I was clear of the DEW line\\n now, rapidly approaching atmosphere.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Z four-oh-two,\\\" the speaker crackled. \\\"This is planetary control. I am\\n picking you up on channel forty-three, for re-entry and let-down.\\\"\\n\\n\\n There was a long pause. Then:\\n\\n\\n \\\"Z four-oh-two, countermand DEW Line clearance! Repeat, clearance\\n countermanded! Emergency course change to standard hyperbolic code\\n ninety-eight. Do not attempt re-entry. Repeat: do not attempt re-entry!\\\"\\n\\n\\n It hadn't taken Kayle long to see that I'd gotten past the outer line\\n of defense. A few more minutes' grace would have helped. I'd play it\\n dumb, and hope for a little luck.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Planetary, Z four-oh-two here. Say, I'm afraid I missed part of that,\\n fellows.

And again I reached out\\u2014\\n\\n\\n A radar man at a site in the Pacific, fifteen thousand miles away, rose\\n from his chair, crossed the darkened room and threw a switch. The radar\\n screens blanked off....\\n\\n\\n For an hour I rode the long orbit down, fending off attack after\\n attack. Then I was clear, skimming the surface of the ocean a few miles\\n southeast of Key West. The boat hit hard. I felt the floor rise up,\\n over, buffeting me against the restraining harness.\\n\\n\\n I hauled at the release lever, felt a long moment of giddy\\n disorientation as the escape capsule separated from the sinking\\n lifeboat deep under the surface. Then my escape capsule was bobbing on\\n the water.\\n\\n\\n I would have to risk calling Kayle now\\u2014but by voluntarily giving my\\n position away, I should convince him I was still on our side\\u2014and I was\\n badly in need of a pick-up. I flipped the sending key.\\n\\n\\n \\\"This is Z four-oh-two,\\\" I said. \\\"I have an urgent report for Colonel\\n Kayle of Aerospace Intelligence.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Kayle's face appeared. \\\"Don't fight it, Granthan,\\\" he croaked. \\\"You\\n penetrated the planetary defenses\\u2014God knows how.

Try to understand....\\\"\\n\\n\\n I flipped the switch, sat gripping the couch, my stomach rising with\\n each heave of the floating escape capsule. I had perhaps five minutes.\\n The missiles would be from Canaveral.\\n\\n\\n I closed my eyes, forced myself to relax, reached out....\\n\\n\\n I sensed the distant shore, the hot buzz of human minds at work in the\\n cities. I followed the coastline, found the Missile Base, flicked\\n through the cluster of minds.\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\u2014\\nmissile on course; do right, baby. That's it, right in the slot.\\n\\\"\\n\\n\\n I fingered my way through the man's mind and found the control centers.\\n He turned stiffly from the plotting board, tottered to a panel to slam\\n his hand against the destruct button.\\n\\n\\n Men fell on him, dragged him back. \\\"\\u2014\\nfool, why did you blow it?\\n\\\"\\n\\n\\n I dropped the contact, found another, who leaped to the panel,\\n detonated the remainder of the flight of six missiles. Then I withdrew.\\n I would have a few minutes' stay of execution now.\\n\\n\\n I was ten miles from shore. The capsule had its own power plant. I\\n started it up, switched on the external viewer. I saw dark sea, the\\n glint of star-light on the choppy surface, in the distance a glow on\\n the horizon that would be Key West. I plugged the course into the\\n pilot, then leaned back and felt outward with my mind for the next\\n attacker.\\nIV\\n\\n\\n It was dark in the trainyard. I moved along the tracks in a stumbling\\n walk. Just a few more minutes, I was telling myself.\\nA few more\\n minutes and you can lie down ... rest....\\nThe shadowed bulk of a box car loomed up, its open door a blacker\\n square. I leaned against the sill, breathing hard, then reached inside\\n for a grip with my good hand.\\n\\n\\n Gravel scrunched nearby. The beam of a flashlight lanced out, slipped\\n along the weathered car, caught me. There was a startled exclamation.\\n I ducked back, closed my eyes, felt out for his mind. There was a\\n confused murmur of thought, a random intrusion of impressions from the\\n city all around. It was hard, too hard. I had to sleep\\u2014\\n\\n\\n I heard the snick of a revolver being cocked, and dropped flat as a\\n gout of flame stabbed toward me, the imperative Bam! echoing between\\n the cars. I caught the clear thought:\\n\\n\\n \\\"God-awful looking, shaved head, arm stuck out; him all right\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n I reached out to his mind and struck at random. The light fell, went\\n out, and I heard the unconscious body slam to the ground like a poled\\n steer.\\n\\n\\n It was easy\\u2014if I could only stay awake.\\n\\n\\n I gritted my teeth, pulled myself into the car, crawled to a dark\\n corner behind a crate and slumped down. I tried to evoke a personality\\n fraction to set as a guard, a part of my mind to stay awake and warn\\n me of danger. It was too much trouble. I relaxed and let it all slide\\n down into darkness.\\nThe car swayed, click-clack, click-clack. I opened my eyes, saw yellow\\n sunlight in a bar across the litter on the floor. The power truss\\n creaked, pulling at my arm. My broken leg was throbbing its indignation\\n at the treatment it had received\\u2014walking brace and all\\u2014and the burned\\n arm was yelling aloud for more of that nice dope that had been keeping\\n it from realizing how bad it was. All things considered, I felt like a\\n badly embalmed mummy\\u2014except that I was hungry. I had been a fool not\\n to fill my pockets when I left the escape capsule in the shallows off\\n Key Largo, but things had been happening too fast.\\n\\n\\n I had barely made it to the fishing boat, whose owner I had coerced\\n into rendezvousing with me before shells started dropping around us. If\\n the gunners on the cruiser ten miles away had had any luck, they would\\n have finished me\\u2014and the hapless fisherman\\u2014right then. We rode out a\\n couple of near misses, before I put the cruiser's gunnery crew off the\\n air.\\n\\n\\n At a fishing camp on the beach, I found a car\\u2014with driver. He dropped\\n me at the railyard, and drove off under the impression he was in town\\n for groceries. He'd never believe he'd seen me.\\n\\n\\n Now I'd had my sleep. I had to start getting ready for the next act of\\n the farce.\\n\\n\\n I pressed the release on the power truss, gingerly unclamped it, then\\n rigged a sling from a strip of shirt tail. I tied the arm to my side as\\n inconspicuously as possible. I didn't disturb the bandages.\\n\\n\\n I needed new clothes\\u2014or at least different ones\\u2014and something to\\n cover my shaved skull. I couldn't stay hidden forever. The yard cop had\\n recognized me at a glance.\\n\\n\\n I lay back, waiting for the train to slow for a town. I wasn't unduly\\n worried\\u2014at the moment. The watchman probably hadn't convinced anyone\\n he'd actually seen me. Maybe he hadn't been too sure himself.\\n\\n\\n The click-clack slowed and the train shuddered to a stop. I crept to\\n the door, peered through the crack. There were sunny fields, a few low\\n buildings in the distance, the corner of a platform. I closed my eyes\\n and let my awareness stretch out.\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\u2014\\nlousy job. What's the use? Little witch in the lunch room ... up in\\n the hills, squirrel hunting, bottle of whiskey....\\n\\\"\\n\\n\\n I settled into control gently, trying not to alarm the man. I saw\\n through his eyes the dusty box car, the rust on the tracks, the\\n listless weeds growing among cinders, and the weathered boards of\\n the platform. I turned him, and saw the dingy glass of the telegraph\\n window, a sagging screen door with a chipped enameled cola sign.\\n\\n\\n I walked the man to the door, and through it. Behind a linoleum-topped\\n counter, a coarse-skinned teen-age girl with heavy breasts and wet\\n patches under her arms looked up without interest as the door banged.\\n\\n\\n My host went on to the counter, gestured toward the waxed-paper-wrapped\\n sandwiches under a glass cover. \\\"I'll take 'em all. And candy bars, and\\n cigarettes. And give me a big glass of water.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Better git out there and look after yer train,\\\" the girl said\\n carelessly. \\\"When'd you git so all-fired hungry all of a sudden?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Put it in a bag. Quick.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Look who's getting bossy\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n My host rounded the counter, picked up a used paper bag, began stuffing\\n food in it. The girl stared at him, then pushed him back. \\\"You git back\\n around that counter!\\\"\\n\\n\\n She filled the bag, took a pencil from behind her ear.\\n\\n\\n \\\"That'll be one eighty-five. Cash.\\\"\\n\\n\\n My host took two dog-eared bills from his shirt pocket, dropped them\\n on the counter and waited while the girl filled a glass. He picked it\\n up and started out.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Hey! Where you goin' with my glass?\\\"\\n\\n\\n The trainman crossed the platform, headed for the boxcar. He slid the\\n loose door back a few inches against the slack latch, pushed the bag\\n inside, placed the glass of water beside it, then pulled off his grimy\\n railroader's cap and pushed it through the opening. He turned. The girl\\n watched from the platform. A rattle passed down the line and the train\\n started up with a lurch. The man walked back toward the girl. I heard\\n him say: \\\"Friend o' mine in there\\u2014just passin' through.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I was discovering that it wasn't necessary to hold tight control over\\n every move of a subject. Once given the impulse to act, he would\\n rationalize his behavior, fill in the details\\u2014and never know that the\\n original idea hadn't been his own.\\n\\n\\n I drank the water first, ate a sandwich, then lit a cigarette and lay\\n back. So far so good. The crates in the car were marked \\\"U. S. Naval\\n Aerospace Station, Bayou Le Cochon\\\". With any luck I'd reach New\\n Orleans in another twelve hours. The first step of my plan included a\\n raid on the Delta National Labs; but that was tomorrow. That could\\n wait.\\nIt was a little before dawn when I crawled out of the car at a siding\\n in the swampy country a few miles out of New Orleans. I wasn't feeling\\n good, but I had a stake in staying on my feet. I still had a few miles\\n in me. I had my supplies\\u2014a few candy bars and some cigarettes\\u2014stuffed\\n in the pockets of the tattered issue coverall. Otherwise, I was\\n unencumbered. Unless you wanted to count the walking brace on my right\\n leg and the sling binding my arm.\\n\\n\\n I picked my way across mushy ground to a pot-holed black-top road,\\n started limping toward a few car lights visible half a mile away. It\\n was already hot. The swamp air was like warmed-over subway fumes.\\n Through the drugs, I could feel my pulse throbbing in my various\\n wounds. I reached out and touched the driver's mind; he was thinking\\n about shrimps, a fish-hook wound on his left thumb and a girl with\\n black hair. \\\"Want a lift?\\\" he called.\\n\\n\\n I thanked him and got in. He gave me a glance and I pinched off his\\n budding twinge of curiosity. It was almost an effort now not to follow\\n his thoughts. It was as though my mind, having learned the trick of\\n communications with others, instinctively reached out toward them.\\n\\n\\n An hour later he dropped me on a street corner in a shabby marketing\\n district of the city and drove off. I hoped he made out all right with\\n the dark-haired girl. I spotted a used-clothing store and headed for it.\\n\\n\\n Twenty minutes later I was back on the sidewalk, dressed in a\\n pinkish-gray suit that had been cut a long time ago by a Latin\\n tailor\\u2014maybe to settle a grudge. The shirt that went with it was\\n an unsuccessful violet. The black string tie lent a dubious air of\\n distinction. I'd swapped the railroader's cap for a tarnished beret.\\n The man who had supplied the outfit was still asleep. I figured\\n I'd done him a favor by taking it. I couldn't hope to pass for a\\n fisherman\\u2014I wasn't the type. Maybe I'd get by as a coffee-house\\n derelict.\\n\\n\\n I walked past fly-covered fish stalls, racks of faded garments, grimy\\n vegetables in bins, enough paint-flaked wrought iron to cage a herd of\\n brontosauri, and fetched up at a cab stand. I picked a fat driver with\\n a wart.\\n\\n\\n \\\"How much to the Delta National Laboratories?\\\"\\n\\n\\n He rolled an eye toward me, shifted his toothpick.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What ya wanna go out there for? Nothing out there.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'm a tourist,\\\" I said. \\\"They told me before I left home not to miss\\n it.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He grunted, reached back and opened the door. I got in. He flipped his\\n flag down, started up with a clash of gears and pulled out without\\n looking.\\n\\n\\n \\\"How far is it?\\\" I asked him.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It ain't far. Mile, mile and a quarter.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Pretty big place, I guess.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He didn't answer.\\n\\n\\n We went through a warehousing district, swung left along the\\n waterfront, bumped over railroad tracks, and pulled up at a nine-foot\\n cyclone fence with a locked gate.\\n\\n\\n \\\"A buck ten,\\\" my driver said.\\n\\n\\n I looked out at the fence, a barren field, a distant group of low\\n buildings. \\\"What's this?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"This is the place you ast for. That'll be a buck ten, mister.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I touched his mind, planted a couple of false impressions and withdrew.\\n He blinked, then started up, drove around the field, pulled up at an\\n open gate with a blue-uniformed guard. He looked back at me.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You want I should drive in, sir?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'll get out here.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He jumped out, opened my door, helped me out with a hand under my good\\n elbow. \\\"I'll get your change, sir,\\\" he said, reaching for his hip.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Keep it.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Thank YOU.\\\" He hesitated. \\\"Maybe I oughta stick around. You know.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'll be all right.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I hope so,\\\" he said. \\\"A man like you\\u2014you and me\\u2014\\\" he winked. \\\"After\\n all, we ain't both wearing berets fer nothing.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"True,\\\" I said. \\\"Consider your tip doubled.

And then I was awake\\u2014and the fire was still there, fiercely\\n burning at me.\\n\\n\\n I tried to move to get away from the flames, and then the real pain\\n hit me. I tried to go back to sleep and the relative comfort of the\\n river of fire, but it was no go. For better or worse, I was alive and\\n conscious.\\n\\n\\n I opened my eyes and took a look around. I was on the floor next to\\n an unpadded acceleration couch\\u2014the kind the Terrestrial Space Arm\\n installs in seldom-used lifeboats. There were three more couches, but\\n no one in them. I tried to sit up. It wasn't easy but, by applying a\\n lot more will-power than should be required of a sick man, I made it.\\n I took a look at my left arm. Baked. The hand was only medium rare,\\n but the forearm was black, with deep red showing at the bottom of the\\n cracks where the crisped upper layers had burst....\\n\\n\\n There was a first-aid cabinet across the compartment from me. I\\n tried my right leg, felt broken bone-ends grate with a sensation\\n that transcended pain. I heaved with the other leg, scrabbled with\\n the charred arm. The crawl to the cabinet dwarfed Hillary's trek\\n up Everest, but I reached it after a couple of years, and found the\\n microswitch on the floor that activated the thing, and then I was\\n fading out again....\\nI came out of it clear-headed but weak. My right leg was numb, but\\n reasonably comfortable, clamped tight in a walking brace. I put up\\n a hand and felt a shaved skull, with sutures. It must have been a\\n fracture. The left arm\\u2014well, it was still there, wrapped to the\\n shoulder and held out stiffly by a power truss that would keep the scar\\n tissue from pulling up and crippling me. The steady pressure as the\\n truss contracted wasn't anything to do a sense-tape on for replaying at\\n leisure moments, but at least the cabinet hadn't amputated. I wasn't\\n complaining.\\n\\n\\n As far as I knew, I was the first recorded survivor of contact with the\\n Gool\\u2014if I survived.\\n\\n\\n I was still a long way from home, and I hadn't yet checked on the\\n condition of the lifeboat. I glanced toward the entry port. It was\\n dogged shut. I could see black marks where my burned hand had been at\\n work.\\n\\n\\n I fumbled my way into a couch and tried to think. In my condition\\u2014with\\n a broken leg and third-degree burns, plus a fractured skull\\u2014I\\n shouldn't have been able to fall out of bed, much less make the trip\\n from\\nBelshazzar's\\nCCC to the boat; and how had I managed to dog that\\n port shut? In an emergency a man was capable of great exertions. But\\n running on a broken femur, handling heavy levers with charred fingers\\n and thinking with a cracked head were overdoing it. Still, I was\\n here\\u2014and it was time to get a call through to TSA headquarters.\\n\\n\\n I flipped the switch and gave the emergency call-letters Col. Ausar\\n Kayle of Aerospace Intelligence had assigned to me a few weeks before.\\n It was almost five minutes before the \\\"acknowledge\\\" came through from\\n the Ganymede relay station, another ten minutes before Kayle's face\\n swam into view. Even through the blur of the screen I could see the\\n haggard look.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Granthan!\\\" he burst out. \\\"Where are the others? What happened out\\n there?\\\" I turned him down to a mutter.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Hold on,\\\" I said. \\\"I'll tell you. Recorders going?\\\" I didn't wait for\\n an answer\\u2014not with a fifteen-minute transmission lag. I plowed on:\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nBelshazzar\\nwas sabotaged. So was\\nGilgamesh\\n\\u2014I think. I got out. I\\n lost a little skin, but the aid cabinet has the case in hand. Tell the\\n Med people the drinks are on me.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I finished talking and flopped back, waiting for Kayle's reply. On the\\n screen, his flickering image gazed back impatiently, looking as hostile\\n as a swing-shift ward nurse. It would be half an hour before I would\\n get his reaction to my report. I dozed off\\u2014and awoke with a start.\\n Kayle was talking.\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\u2014your report. I won't mince words. They're wondering at your role in\\n the disaster. How does it happen that you alone survived?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"How the hell do I know?\\\" I yelled\\u2014or croaked. But Kayle's voice was\\n droning on:\\n\\n\\n \\\"... you Psychodynamics people have been telling me the Gool may\\n have some kind of long-range telehypnotic ability that might make it\\n possible for them to subvert a loyal man without his knowledge. You've\\n told me yourself that you blacked out during the attack\\u2014and came to on\\n the lifeboat, with no recollection of how you got there.\\n\\n\\n \\\"This is war, Granthan. War against a vicious enemy who strike without\\n warning and without mercy. You were sent out to investigate the\\n possibility of\\u2014what's that term you use?\\u2014hyper-cortical invasion. You\\n know better than most the risk I'd be running if you were allowed to\\n pass the patrol line.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'm sorry, Granthan. I can't let you land on Earth. I can't accept\\n the risk.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"What do I do now?\\\" I stormed. \\\"Go into orbit and eat pills and hope\\n you think of something? I need a doctor!\\\"\\n\\n\\n Presently Kayle replied. \\\"Yes,\\\" he said. \\\"You'll have to enter a\\n parking orbit. Perhaps there will be developments soon which will make\\n it possible to ... ah ... restudy the situation.\\\" He didn't meet my\\n eye. I knew what he was thinking. He'd spare me the mental anguish of\\n knowing what was coming. I couldn't really blame him; he was doing\\n what he thought was the right thing. And I'd have to go along and\\n pretend\\u2014right up until the warheads struck\\u2014that I didn't know I'd\\n been condemned to death.\\nII\\n\\n\\n I tried to gather my wits and think my way through the situation. I\\n was alone and injured, aboard a lifeboat that would be the focus of a\\n converging flight of missiles as soon as I approached within battery\\n range of Earth. I had gotten clear of the Gool, but I wouldn't survive\\n my next meeting with my own kind. They couldn't take the chance that I\\n was acting under Gool orders.\\n\\n\\n I wasn't, of course. I was still the same Peter Granthan,\\n psychodynamicist, who had started out with Dayan's fleet six weeks\\n earlier. The thoughts I was having weren't brilliant, but they were\\n mine, all mine....\\n\\n\\n But how could I be sure of that?\\n\\n\\n Maybe there was something in Kayle's suspicion. If the Gool were as\\n skillful as we thought, they would have left no overt indications of\\n their tampering\\u2014not at a conscious level.\\n\\n\\n But this was where psychodynamics training came in. I had been reacting\\n like any scared casualty, aching to get home and lick his wounds. But I\\n wasn't just any casualty. I had been trained in the subtleties of the\\n mind\\u2014and I had been prepared for just such an attack.\\n\\n\\n Now was the time to make use of that training. It had given me one\\n resource. I could unlock the memories of my subconscious\\u2014and see again\\n what had happened.\\n\\n\\n I lay back, cleared my mind of extraneous thoughts, and concentrated on\\n the trigger word that would key an auto-hypnotic sequence....\\n\\n\\n Sense impressions faded. I was alone in the nebulous emptiness of a\\n first-level trance. I keyed a second word, slipped below the misty\\n surface into a dreamworld of vague phantasmagoric figures milling in\\n their limbo of sub-conceptualization. I penetrated deeper, broke\\n through into the vividly hallucinatory third level, where images of\\n mirror-bright immediacy clamored for attention. And deeper....\\nThe immense orderly confusion of the basic memory level lay before\\n me. Abstracted from it, aloof and observant, the monitoring\\n personality-fraction scanned the pattern, searching the polydimensional\\n continuum for evidence of an alien intrusion.\\n\\n\\n And found it.\\n\\n\\n As the eye instantaneously detects a flicker of motion amid an infinity\\n of static detail, so my inner eye perceived the subtle traces of the\\n probing Gool mind, like a whispered touch deftly rearranging my buried\\n motivations.\\n\\n\\n I focused selectively, tuned to the recorded gestalt.\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nIt is a contact, Effulgent One!\\n\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nSoftly, now! Nurture the spark well. It but trembles at the\\n threshold....\\n\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nIt is elusive, Master! It wriggles like a gorm-worm in the eating\\n trough!\\n\\\"\\n\\n\\n A part of my mind watched as the memory unreeled. I listened to the\\n voices\\u2014yet not voices, merely the shape of concepts, indescribably\\n intricate. I saw how the decoy pseudo-personality which I had\\n concretized for the purpose in a hundred training sessions had fought\\n against the intruding stimuli\\u2014then yielded under the relentless thrust\\n of the alien probe. I watched as the Gool operator took over the motor\\n centers, caused me to crawl through the choking smoke of the devastated\\n control compartment toward the escape hatch. Fire leaped up, blocking\\n the way. I went on, felt ghostly flames whipping at me\\u2014and then the\\n hatch was open and I pulled myself through, forcing the broken leg.\\n My blackened hand fumbled at the locking wheel. Then the blast as\\n the lifeboat leaped clear of the disintegrating dreadnought\\u2014and the\\n world-ending impact as I fell.\\n\\n\\n At a level far below the conscious, the embattled pseudo-personality\\n lashed out again\\u2014fighting the invader.\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nAlmost it eluded me then, Effulgent Lord. Link with this lowly one!\\n\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nImpossible! Do you forget all my teachings? Cling, though you expend\\n the last filament of your life-force!\\n\\\"\\n\\n\\n Free from all distraction, at a level where comprehension and retention\\n are instantaneous and total, my monitoring basic personality fraction\\n followed the skillful Gool mind as it engraved its commands deep in\\n my subconscious. Then the touch withdrew, erasing the scars of its\\n passage, to leave me unaware of its tampering\\u2014at a conscious level.\\n\\n\\n Watching the Gool mind, I learned.\\n\\n\\n The insinuating probe\\u2014a concept regarding which psychodynamicists had\\n theorized\\u2014was no more than a pattern in emptiness....\\n\\n\\n But a pattern which I could duplicate, now that I had seen what had\\n been done to me.\\n\\n\\n Hesitantly, I felt for the immaterial fabric of the continuum, warping\\n and manipulating it, copying the Gool probe. Like planes of paper-thin\\n crystal, the polyfinite aspects of reality shifted into focus, aligning\\n themselves.\\n\\n\\n Abruptly, a channel lay open. As easily as I would stretch out my hand\\n to pluck a moth from a night-flower, I reached across the unimaginable\\n void\\u2014and sensed a pit blacker than the bottom floor of hell, and a\\n glistening dark shape.\\n\\n\\n There was a soundless shriek. \\\"\\nEffulgence! It reached out\\u2014touched\\n me!\\n\\\"\\nUsing the technique I had grasped from the Gool itself, I struck,\\n stifling the outcry, invaded the fetid blackness and grappled the\\n obscene gelatinous immensity of the Gool spy as it spasmed in a frenzy\\n of xenophobia\\u2014a ton of liver writhing at the bottom of a dark well.\\n\\n\\n I clamped down control. The Gool mind folded in on itself, gibbering.\\n Not pausing to rest, I followed up, probed along my channel of contact,\\n tracing patterns, scanning the flaccid Gool mind....\\n\\n\\n I saw a world of yellow seas lapping at endless shores of mud. There\\n was a fuming pit, where liquid sulphur bubbled up from some inner\\n source, filling an immense natural basin. The Gool clustered at its\\n rim, feeding, each monstrous shape heaving against its neighbors for a\\n more favorable position.\\nI probed farther, saw the great cables of living nervous tissue that\\n linked each eating organ with the brain-mass far underground. I traced\\n the passages through which tendrils ran out to immense caverns where\\n smaller creatures labored over strange devices. These, my host's memory\\n told me, were the young of the Gool. Here they built the fleets that\\n would transport the spawn to the new worlds the Prime Overlord had\\n discovered, worlds where food was free for the taking. Not sulphur\\n alone, but potassium, calcium, iron and all the metals\\u2014riches\\n beyond belief in endless profusion. No longer would the Gool tribe\\n cluster\\u2014those who remained of a once-great race\\u2014at a single feeding\\n trough. They would spread out across a galaxy\\u2014and beyond.\\n\\n\\n But not if I could help it.\\n\\n\\n The Gool had evolved a plan\\u2014but they'd had a stroke of bad luck.\\n\\n\\n In the past, they had managed to control a man here and there, among\\n the fleets, far from home, but only at a superficial level. Enough,\\n perhaps, to wreck a ship, but not the complete control needed to send a\\n man back to Earth under Gool compulsion, to carry out complex sabotage.\\n\\n\\n Then they had found me, alone, a sole survivor, free from the clutter\\n of the other mind-fields. It had been their misfortune to pick a\\n psychodynamicist. Instead of gaining a patient slave, they had opened\\n the fortress door to an unseen spy. Now that I was there, I would see\\n what I could steal.\\n\\n\\n A timeless time passed. I wandered among patterns of white light and\\n white sound, plumbed the deepest recesses of hidden Gool thoughts,\\n fared along strange ways examining the shapes and colors of the\\n concepts of an alien mind.\\n\\n\\n I paused at last, scanning a multi-ordinal structure of pattern within\\n pattern; the diagrammed circuits of a strange machine.\\n\\n\\n I followed through its logic-sequence; and, like a bomb-burst, its\\n meaning exploded in my mind.\\n\\n\\n From the vile nest deep under the dark surface of the Gool world in\\n its lonely trans-Plutonian orbit, I had plucked the ultimate secret of\\n their kind.\\n\\n\\n Matter across space.\\n\\\"You've got to listen to me, Kayle,\\\" I shouted. \\\"I know you think I'm\\n a Gool robot. But what I have is too big to let you blow it up without\\n a fight. Matter transmission! You know what that can mean to us. The\\n concept is too complex to try to describe in words. You'll have to take\\n my word for it. I can build it, though, using standard components, plus\\n an infinite-area antenna and a moebius-wound coil\\u2014and a few other\\n things....\\\"\\n\\n\\n I harangued Kayle for a while, and then sweated out his answer. I was\\n getting close now. If he couldn't see the beauty of my proposal, my\\n screens would start to register the radiation of warheads any time now.\\n\\n\\n Kayle came back\\u2014and his answer boiled down to \\\"no.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I tried to reason with him. I reminded him how I had readied myself\\n for the trip with sessions on the encephaloscope, setting up the\\n cross-networks of conditioned defensive responses, the shunt circuits\\n to the decoy pseudo-personality, leaving my volitional ego free. I\\n talked about subliminal hypnotics and the resilience quotient of the\\n ego-complex.\\n\\n\\n I might have saved my breath.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I don't understand that psychodynamics jargon, Granthan,\\\" he snapped.\\n \\\"It smacks of mysticism. But I understand what the Gool have done to\\n you well enough. I'm sorry.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I leaned back and chewed the inside of my lip and thought unkind\\n thoughts about Colonel Ausar Kayle. Then I settled down to solve the\\n problem at hand.\\n\\n\\n I keyed the chart file, flashed pages from the standard index on the\\n reference screen, checking radar coverages, beacon ranges, monitor\\n stations, controller fields. It looked as though a radar-negative boat\\n the size of mine might possibly get through the defensive net with a\\n daring pilot, and as a condemned spy, I could afford to be daring.\\n\\n\\n And I had a few ideas.\\nIII\\n\\n\\n The shrilling of the proximity alarm blasted through the silence. For a\\n wild moment I thought Kayle had beaten me to the punch; then I realized\\n it was the routine DEW line patrol contact.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Z four-oh-two, I am reading your IFF. Decelerate at 1.8 gee\\n preparatory to picking up approach orbit....\\\"\\n\\n\\n The screen went on droning out instructions. I fed them into the\\n autopilot, at the same time running over my approach plan. The scout\\n was moving in closer. I licked dry lips. It was time to try.\\n\\n\\n I closed my eyes, reached out\\u2014as the Gool mind had reached out to\\n me\\u2014and felt the touch of a Signals Officer's mind, forty thousand\\n miles distant, aboard the patrol vessel. There was a brief flurry of\\n struggle; then I dictated my instructions. The Signals Officer punched\\n keys, spoke into his microphone:\\n\\n\\n \\\"As you were, Z four-oh-two. Continue on present course. At Oh-nineteen\\n seconds, pick up planetary for re-entry and let-down.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I blanked out the man's recollection of what had happened, caught his\\n belated puzzlement as I broke contact. But I was clear of the DEW line\\n now, rapidly approaching atmosphere.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Z four-oh-two,\\\" the speaker crackled. \\\"This is planetary control. I am\\n picking you up on channel forty-three, for re-entry and let-down.\\\"\\n\\n\\n There was a long pause. Then:\\n\\n\\n \\\"Z four-oh-two, countermand DEW Line clearance! Repeat, clearance\\n countermanded! Emergency course change to standard hyperbolic code\\n ninety-eight. Do not attempt re-entry. Repeat: do not attempt re-entry!\\\"\\n\\n\\n It hadn't taken Kayle long to see that I'd gotten past the outer line\\n of defense. A few more minutes' grace would have helped. I'd play it\\n dumb, and hope for a little luck.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Planetary, Z four-oh-two here. Say, I'm afraid I missed part of that,\\n fellows. I'm a little banged up\\u2014I guess I switched frequencies on you.\\n What was that after 'pick up channel forty-three'...?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Four-oh-two, sheer off there! You're not cleared for re-entry!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Hey, you birds are mixed up,\\\" I protested. \\\"I'm cleared all the way. I\\n checked in with DEW\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n It was time to disappear. I blanked off all transmission, hit the\\n controls, following my evasive pattern. And again I reached out\\u2014\\n\\n\\n A radar man at a site in the Pacific, fifteen thousand miles away, rose\\n from his chair, crossed the darkened room and threw a switch. The radar\\n screens blanked off....\\n\\n\\n For an hour I rode the long orbit down, fending off attack after\\n attack. Then I was clear, skimming the surface of the ocean a few miles\\n southeast of Key West. The boat hit hard. I felt the floor rise up,\\n over, buffeting me against the restraining harness.\\n\\n\\n I hauled at the release lever, felt a long moment of giddy\\n disorientation as the escape capsule separated from the sinking\\n lifeboat deep under the surface. Then my escape capsule was bobbing on\\n the water.\\n\\n\\n I would have to risk calling Kayle now\\u2014but by voluntarily giving my\\n position away, I should convince him I was still on our side\\u2014and I was\\n badly in need of a pick-up. I flipped the sending key.\\n\\n\\n \\\"This is Z four-oh-two,\\\" I said. \\\"I have an urgent report for Colonel\\n Kayle of Aerospace Intelligence.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Kayle's face appeared. \\\"Don't fight it, Granthan,\\\" he croaked. \\\"You\\n penetrated the planetary defenses\\u2014God knows how. I\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Later,\\\" I snapped. \\\"How about calling off your dogs now? And send\\n somebody out here to pick me up, before I add sea-sickness to my other\\n complaints.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"We have you pinpointed,\\\" Kayle cut in. \\\"It's no use fighting it,\\n Granthan.\\\"\\nI felt cold sweat pop out on my forehead. \\\"You've got to listen,\\n Kayle,\\\" I shouted. \\\"I suppose you've got missiles on the way already.\\n Call them back! I have information that can win the war\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'm sorry, Granthan,\\\" Kayle said. \\\"It's too late\\u2014even if I could\\n take the chance you were right.\\\"\\n\\n\\n A different face appeared on the screen.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Mr. Granthan, I am General Titus. On behalf of your country, and\\n in the name of the President\\u2014who has been apprised of this tragic\\n situation\\u2014it is my privilege to inform you that you will be awarded\\n the Congressional Medal of Honor\\u2014posthumously\\u2014for your heroic effort.\\n Although you failed, and have in fact been forced, against your will,\\n to carry out the schemes of the inhuman enemy, this in no way detracts\\n from your gallant attempt. Mr. Granthan, I salute you.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The general's arm went up in a rigid gesture.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Stow that, you pompous idiot!\\\" I barked. \\\"I'm no spy!\\\"\\n\\n\\n Kayle was back, blanking out the startled face of the general.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Goodbye, Granthan. Try to understand....\\\"\\n\\n\\n I flipped the switch, sat gripping the couch, my stomach rising with\\n each heave of the floating escape capsule. I had perhaps five minutes.\\n The missiles would be from Canaveral.\\n\\n\\n I closed my eyes, forced myself to relax, reached out....\\n\\n\\n I sensed the distant shore, the hot buzz of human minds at work in the\\n cities. I followed the coastline, found the Missile Base, flicked\\n through the cluster of minds.\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\u2014\\nmissile on course; do right, baby. That's it, right in the slot.\\n\\\"\\n\\n\\n I fingered my way through the man's mind and found the control centers.\\n He turned stiffly from the plotting board, tottered to a panel to slam\\n his hand against the destruct button.\\n\\n\\n Men fell on him, dragged him back. \\\"\\u2014\\nfool, why did you blow it?\\n\\\"\\n\\n\\n I dropped the contact, found another, who leaped to the panel,\\n detonated the remainder of the flight of six missiles. Then I withdrew.\\n I would have a few minutes' stay of execution now.\\n\\n\\n I was ten miles from shore. The capsule had its own power plant. I\\n started it up, switched on the external viewer. I saw dark sea, the\\n glint of star-light on the choppy surface, in the distance a glow on\\n the horizon that would be Key West. I plugged the course into the\\n pilot, then leaned back and felt outward with my mind for the next\\n attacker.\\nIV\\n\\n\\n It was dark in the trainyard. I moved along the tracks in a stumbling\\n walk. Just a few more minutes, I was telling myself.\\nA few more\\n minutes and you can lie down ... rest....\\nThe shadowed bulk of a box car loomed up, its open door a blacker\\n square. I leaned against the sill, breathing hard, then reached inside\\n for a grip with my good hand.\\n\\n\\n Gravel scrunched nearby. The beam of a flashlight lanced out, slipped\\n along the weathered car, caught me. There was a startled exclamation.\\n I ducked back, closed my eyes, felt out for his mind. There was a\\n confused murmur of thought, a random intrusion of impressions from the\\n city all around. It was hard, too hard. I had to sleep\\u2014\\n\\n\\n I heard the snick of a revolver being cocked, and dropped flat as a\\n gout of flame stabbed toward me, the imperative Bam! echoing between\\n the cars. I caught the clear thought:\\n\\n\\n \\\"God-awful looking, shaved head, arm stuck out; him all right\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n I reached out to his mind and struck at random. The light fell, went\\n out, and I heard the unconscious body slam to the ground like a poled\\n steer.\\n\\n\\n It was easy\\u2014if I could only stay awake.\\n\\n\\n I gritted my teeth, pulled myself into the car, crawled to a dark\\n corner behind a crate and slumped down. I tried to evoke a personality\\n fraction to set as a guard, a part of my mind to stay awake and warn\\n me of danger. It was too much trouble. I relaxed and let it all slide\\n down into darkness.\\nThe car swayed, click-clack, click-clack. I opened my eyes, saw yellow\\n sunlight in a bar across the litter on the floor. The power truss\\n creaked, pulling at my arm. My broken leg was throbbing its indignation\\n at the treatment it had received\\u2014walking brace and all\\u2014and the burned\\n arm was yelling aloud for more of that nice dope that had been keeping\\n it from realizing how bad it was. All things considered, I felt like a\\n badly embalmed mummy\\u2014except that I was hungry. I had been a fool not\\n to fill my pockets when I left the escape capsule in the shallows off\\n Key Largo, but things had been happening too fast.\\n\\n\\n I had barely made it to the fishing boat, whose owner I had coerced\\n into rendezvousing with me before shells started dropping around us. If\\n the gunners on the cruiser ten miles away had had any luck, they would\\n have finished me\\u2014and the hapless fisherman\\u2014right then. We rode out a\\n couple of near misses, before I put the cruiser's gunnery crew off the\\n air.\\n\\n\\n At a fishing camp on the beach, I found a car\\u2014with driver. He dropped\\n me at the railyard, and drove off under the impression he was in town\\n for groceries. He'd never believe he'd seen me.\\n\\n\\n Now I'd had my sleep. I had to start getting ready for the next act of\\n the farce.\\n\\n\\n I pressed the release on the power truss, gingerly unclamped it, then\\n rigged a sling from a strip of shirt tail. I tied the arm to my side as\\n inconspicuously as possible. I didn't disturb the bandages.\\n\\n\\n I needed new clothes\\u2014or at least different ones\\u2014and something to\\n cover my shaved skull. I couldn't stay hidden forever. The yard cop had\\n recognized me at a glance.\\n\\n\\n I lay back, waiting for the train to slow for a town. I wasn't unduly\\n worried\\u2014at the moment. The watchman probably hadn't convinced anyone\\n he'd actually seen me. Maybe he hadn't been too sure himself.\\n\\n\\n The click-clack slowed and the train shuddered to a stop. I crept to\\n the door, peered through the crack. There were sunny fields, a few low\\n buildings in the distance, the corner of a platform. I closed my eyes\\n and let my awareness stretch out.\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\u2014\\nlousy job. What's the use? Little witch in the lunch room ... up in\\n the hills, squirrel hunting, bottle of whiskey....\\n\\\"\\n\\n\\n I settled into control gently, trying not to alarm the man. I saw\\n through his eyes the dusty box car, the rust on the tracks, the\\n listless weeds growing among cinders, and the weathered boards of\\n the platform. I turned him, and saw the dingy glass of the telegraph\\n window, a sagging screen door with a chipped enameled cola sign.\\n\\n\\n I walked the man to the door, and through it. Behind a linoleum-topped\\n counter, a coarse-skinned teen-age girl with heavy breasts and wet\\n patches under her arms looked up without interest as the door banged.\\n\\n\\n My host went on to the counter, gestured toward the waxed-paper-wrapped\\n sandwiches under a glass cover. \\\"I'll take 'em all. And candy bars, and\\n cigarettes. And give me a big glass of water.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Better git out there and look after yer train,\\\" the girl said\\n carelessly. \\\"When'd you git so all-fired hungry all of a sudden?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Put it in a bag. Quick.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Look who's getting bossy\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n My host rounded the counter, picked up a used paper bag, began stuffing\\n food in it. The girl stared at him, then pushed him back. \\\"You git back\\n around that counter!\\\"\\n\\n\\n She filled the bag, took a pencil from behind her ear.\\n\\n\\n \\\"That'll be one eighty-five. Cash.\\\"\\n\\n\\n My host took two dog-eared bills from his shirt pocket, dropped them\\n on the counter and waited while the girl filled a glass. He picked it\\n up and started out.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Hey! Where you goin' with my glass?\\\"\\n\\n\\n The trainman crossed the platform, headed for the boxcar. He slid the\\n loose door back a few inches against the slack latch, pushed the bag\\n inside, placed the glass of water beside it, then pulled off his grimy\\n railroader's cap and pushed it through the opening. He turned. The girl\\n watched from the platform. A rattle passed down the line and the train\\n started up with a lurch. The man walked back toward the girl. I heard\\n him say: \\\"Friend o' mine in there\\u2014just passin' through.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I was discovering that it wasn't necessary to hold tight control over\\n every move of a subject. Once given the impulse to act, he would\\n rationalize his behavior, fill in the details\\u2014and never know that the\\n original idea hadn't been his own.\\n\\n\\n I drank the water first, ate a sandwich, then lit a cigarette and lay\\n back. So far so good. The crates in the car were marked \\\"U. S. Naval\\n Aerospace Station, Bayou Le Cochon\\\". With any luck I'd reach New\\n Orleans in another twelve hours. The first step of my plan included a\\n raid on the Delta National Labs; but that was tomorrow. That could\\n wait.\\nIt was a little before dawn when I crawled out of the car at a siding\\n in the swampy country a few miles out of New Orleans. I wasn't feeling\\n good, but I had a stake in staying on my feet. I still had a few miles\\n in me. I had my supplies\\u2014a few candy bars and some cigarettes\\u2014stuffed\\n in the pockets of the tattered issue coverall. Otherwise, I was\\n unencumbered. Unless you wanted to count the walking brace on my right\\n leg and the sling binding my arm.\\n\\n\\n I picked my way across mushy ground to a pot-holed black-top road,\\n started limping toward a few car lights visible half a mile away. It\\n was already hot. The swamp air was like warmed-over subway fumes.\\n Through the drugs, I could feel my pulse throbbing in my various\\n wounds. I reached out and touched the driver's mind; he was thinking\\n about shrimps, a fish-hook wound on his left thumb and a girl with\\n black hair. \\\"Want a lift?\\\" he called.\\n\\n\\n I thanked him and got in. He gave me a glance and I pinched off his\\n budding twinge of curiosity. It was almost an effort now not to follow\\n his thoughts. It was as though my mind, having learned the trick of\\n communications with others, instinctively reached out toward them.\\n\\n\\n An hour later he dropped me on a street corner in a shabby marketing\\n district of the city and drove off. I hoped he made out all right with\\n the dark-haired girl. I spotted a used-clothing store and headed for it.\\n\\n\\n Twenty minutes later I was back on the sidewalk, dressed in a\\n pinkish-gray suit that had been cut a long time ago by a Latin\\n tailor\\u2014maybe to settle a grudge. The shirt that went with it was\\n an unsuccessful violet. The black string tie lent a dubious air of\\n distinction. I'd swapped the railroader's cap for a tarnished beret.\\n The man who had supplied the outfit was still asleep. I figured\\n I'd done him a favor by taking it. I couldn't hope to pass for a\\n fisherman\\u2014I wasn't the type. Maybe I'd get by as a coffee-house\\n derelict.\\n\\n\\n I walked past fly-covered fish stalls, racks of faded garments, grimy\\n vegetables in bins, enough paint-flaked wrought iron to cage a herd of\\n brontosauri, and fetched up at a cab stand. I picked a fat driver with\\n a wart.\\n\\n\\n \\\"How much to the Delta National Laboratories?\\\"\\n\\n\\n He rolled an eye toward me, shifted his toothpick.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What ya wanna go out there for? Nothing out there.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'm a tourist,\\\" I said. \\\"They told me before I left home not to miss\\n it.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He grunted, reached back and opened the door. I got in. He flipped his\\n flag down, started up with a clash of gears and pulled out without\\n looking.\\n\\n\\n \\\"How far is it?\\\" I asked him.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It ain't far. Mile, mile and a quarter.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Pretty big place, I guess.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He didn't answer.\\n\\n\\n We went through a warehousing district, swung left along the\\n waterfront, bumped over railroad tracks, and pulled up at a nine-foot\\n cyclone fence with a locked gate.\\n\\n\\n \\\"A buck ten,\\\" my driver said.\\n\\n\\n I looked out at the fence, a barren field, a distant group of low\\n buildings. \\\"What's this?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"This is the place you ast for. That'll be a buck ten, mister.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I touched his mind, planted a couple of false impressions and withdrew.\\n He blinked, then started up, drove around the field, pulled up at an\\n open gate with a blue-uniformed guard. He looked back at me.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You want I should drive in, sir?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'll get out here.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He jumped out, opened my door, helped me out with a hand under my good\\n elbow. \\\"I'll get your change, sir,\\\" he said, reaching for his hip.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Keep it.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Thank YOU.\\\" He hesitated. \\\"Maybe I oughta stick around. You know.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'll be all right.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I hope so,\\\" he said. \\\"A man like you\\u2014you and me\\u2014\\\" he winked. \\\"After\\n all, we ain't both wearing berets fer nothing.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"True,\\\" I said. \\\"Consider your tip doubled.

And then I was awake\\u2014and the fire was still there, fiercely\\n burning at me.\\n\\n\\n I tried to move to get away from the flames, and then the real pain\\n hit me. I tried to go back to sleep and the relative comfort of the\\n river of fire, but it was no go. For better or worse, I was alive and\\n conscious.\\n\\n\\n I opened my eyes and took a look around. I was on the floor next to\\n an unpadded acceleration couch\\u2014the kind the Terrestrial Space Arm\\n installs in seldom-used lifeboats. There were three more couches, but\\n no one in them. I tried to sit up. It wasn't easy but, by applying a\\n lot more will-power than should be required of a sick man, I made it.\\n I took a look at my left arm. Baked. The hand was only medium rare,\\n but the forearm was black, with deep red showing at the bottom of the\\n cracks where the crisped upper layers had burst....\\n\\n\\n There was a first-aid cabinet across the compartment from me. I\\n tried my right leg, felt broken bone-ends grate with a sensation\\n that transcended pain. I heaved with the other leg, scrabbled with\\n the charred arm. The crawl to the cabinet dwarfed Hillary's trek\\n up Everest, but I reached it after a couple of years, and found the\\n microswitch on the floor that activated the thing, and then I was\\n fading out again....\\nI came out of it clear-headed but weak. My right leg was numb, but\\n reasonably comfortable, clamped tight in a walking brace. I put up\\n a hand and felt a shaved skull, with sutures. It must have been a\\n fracture. The left arm\\u2014well, it was still there, wrapped to the\\n shoulder and held out stiffly by a power truss that would keep the scar\\n tissue from pulling up and crippling me. The steady pressure as the\\n truss contracted wasn't anything to do a sense-tape on for replaying at\\n leisure moments, but at least the cabinet hadn't amputated. I wasn't\\n complaining.\\n\\n\\n As far as I knew, I was the first recorded survivor of contact with the\\n Gool\\u2014if I survived.\\n\\n\\n I was still a long way from home, and I hadn't yet checked on the\\n condition of the lifeboat. I glanced toward the entry port. It was\\n dogged shut. I could see black marks where my burned hand had been at\\n work.\\n\\n\\n I fumbled my way into a couch and tried to think. In my condition\\u2014with\\n a broken leg and third-degree burns, plus a fractured skull\\u2014I\\n shouldn't have been able to fall out of bed, much less make the trip\\n from\\nBelshazzar's\\nCCC to the boat; and how had I managed to dog that\\n port shut? In an emergency a man was capable of great exertions. But\\n running on a broken femur, handling heavy levers with charred fingers\\n and thinking with a cracked head were overdoing it. Still, I was\\n here\\u2014and it was time to get a call through to TSA headquarters.\\n\\n\\n I flipped the switch and gave the emergency call-letters Col. Ausar\\n Kayle of Aerospace Intelligence had assigned to me a few weeks before.\\n It was almost five minutes before the \\\"acknowledge\\\" came through from\\n the Ganymede relay station, another ten minutes before Kayle's face\\n swam into view. Even through the blur of the screen I could see the\\n haggard look.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Granthan!\\\" he burst out. \\\"Where are the others? What happened out\\n there?\\\" I turned him down to a mutter.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Hold on,\\\" I said. \\\"I'll tell you. Recorders going?\\\" I didn't wait for\\n an answer\\u2014not with a fifteen-minute transmission lag. I plowed on:\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nBelshazzar\\nwas sabotaged. So was\\nGilgamesh\\n\\u2014I think. I got out. I\\n lost a little skin, but the aid cabinet has the case in hand. Tell the\\n Med people the drinks are on me.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I finished talking and flopped back, waiting for Kayle's reply. On the\\n screen, his flickering image gazed back impatiently, looking as hostile\\n as a swing-shift ward nurse. It would be half an hour before I would\\n get his reaction to my report. I dozed off\\u2014and awoke with a start.\\n Kayle was talking.\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\u2014your report. I won't mince words. They're wondering at your role in\\n the disaster. How does it happen that you alone survived?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"How the hell do I know?\\\" I yelled\\u2014or croaked. But Kayle's voice was\\n droning on:\\n\\n\\n \\\"... you Psychodynamics people have been telling me the Gool may\\n have some kind of long-range telehypnotic ability that might make it\\n possible for them to subvert a loyal man without his knowledge. You've\\n told me yourself that you blacked out during the attack\\u2014and came to on\\n the lifeboat, with no recollection of how you got there.\\n\\n\\n \\\"This is war, Granthan. War against a vicious enemy who strike without\\n warning and without mercy. You were sent out to investigate the\\n possibility of\\u2014what's that term you use?\\u2014hyper-cortical invasion. You\\n know better than most the risk I'd be running if you were allowed to\\n pass the patrol line.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'm sorry, Granthan. I can't let you land on Earth. I can't accept\\n the risk.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"What do I do now?\\\" I stormed. \\\"Go into orbit and eat pills and hope\\n you think of something? I need a doctor!\\\"\\n\\n\\n Presently Kayle replied. \\\"Yes,\\\" he said. \\\"You'll have to enter a\\n parking orbit. Perhaps there will be developments soon which will make\\n it possible to ... ah ... restudy the situation.\\\" He didn't meet my\\n eye. I knew what he was thinking. He'd spare me the mental anguish of\\n knowing what was coming. I couldn't really blame him; he was doing\\n what he thought was the right thing. And I'd have to go along and\\n pretend\\u2014right up until the warheads struck\\u2014that I didn't know I'd\\n been condemned to death.\\nII\\n\\n\\n I tried to gather my wits and think my way through the situation. I\\n was alone and injured, aboard a lifeboat that would be the focus of a\\n converging flight of missiles as soon as I approached within battery\\n range of Earth. I had gotten clear of the Gool, but I wouldn't survive\\n my next meeting with my own kind. They couldn't take the chance that I\\n was acting under Gool orders.\\n\\n\\n I wasn't, of course. I was still the same Peter Granthan,\\n psychodynamicist, who had started out with Dayan's fleet six weeks\\n earlier. The thoughts I was having weren't brilliant, but they were\\n mine, all mine....\\n\\n\\n But how could I be sure of that?\\n\\n\\n Maybe there was something in Kayle's suspicion. If the Gool were as\\n skillful as we thought, they would have left no overt indications of\\n their tampering\\u2014not at a conscious level.\\n\\n\\n But this was where psychodynamics training came in. I had been reacting\\n like any scared casualty, aching to get home and lick his wounds. But I\\n wasn't just any casualty. I had been trained in the subtleties of the\\n mind\\u2014and I had been prepared for just such an attack.\\n\\n\\n Now was the time to make use of that training. It had given me one\\n resource. I could unlock the memories of my subconscious\\u2014and see again\\n what had happened.\\n\\n\\n I lay back, cleared my mind of extraneous thoughts, and concentrated on\\n the trigger word that would key an auto-hypnotic sequence....\\n\\n\\n Sense impressions faded. I was alone in the nebulous emptiness of a\\n first-level trance. I keyed a second word, slipped below the misty\\n surface into a dreamworld of vague phantasmagoric figures milling in\\n their limbo of sub-conceptualization. I penetrated deeper, broke\\n through into the vividly hallucinatory third level, where images of\\n mirror-bright immediacy clamored for attention. And deeper....\\nThe immense orderly confusion of the basic memory level lay before\\n me. Abstracted from it, aloof and observant, the monitoring\\n personality-fraction scanned the pattern, searching the polydimensional\\n continuum for evidence of an alien intrusion.\\n\\n\\n And found it.\\n\\n\\n As the eye instantaneously detects a flicker of motion amid an infinity\\n of static detail, so my inner eye perceived the subtle traces of the\\n probing Gool mind, like a whispered touch deftly rearranging my buried\\n motivations.\\n\\n\\n I focused selectively, tuned to the recorded gestalt.\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nIt is a contact, Effulgent One!\\n\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nSoftly, now! Nurture the spark well. It but trembles at the\\n threshold....\\n\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nIt is elusive, Master! It wriggles like a gorm-worm in the eating\\n trough!\\n\\\"\\n\\n\\n A part of my mind watched as the memory unreeled. I listened to the\\n voices\\u2014yet not voices, merely the shape of concepts, indescribably\\n intricate. I saw how the decoy pseudo-personality which I had\\n concretized for the purpose in a hundred training sessions had fought\\n against the intruding stimuli\\u2014then yielded under the relentless thrust\\n of the alien probe. I watched as the Gool operator took over the motor\\n centers, caused me to crawl through the choking smoke of the devastated\\n control compartment toward the escape hatch. Fire leaped up, blocking\\n the way. I went on, felt ghostly flames whipping at me\\u2014and then the\\n hatch was open and I pulled myself through, forcing the broken leg.\\n My blackened hand fumbled at the locking wheel. Then the blast as\\n the lifeboat leaped clear of the disintegrating dreadnought\\u2014and the\\n world-ending impact as I fell.\\n\\n\\n At a level far below the conscious, the embattled pseudo-personality\\n lashed out again\\u2014fighting the invader.\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nAlmost it eluded me then, Effulgent Lord. Link with this lowly one!\\n\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nImpossible! Do you forget all my teachings? Cling, though you expend\\n the last filament of your life-force!\\n\\\"\\n\\n\\n Free from all distraction, at a level where comprehension and retention\\n are instantaneous and total, my monitoring basic personality fraction\\n followed the skillful Gool mind as it engraved its commands deep in\\n my subconscious. Then the touch withdrew, erasing the scars of its\\n passage, to leave me unaware of its tampering\\u2014at a conscious level.\\n\\n\\n Watching the Gool mind, I learned.\\n\\n\\n The insinuating probe\\u2014a concept regarding which psychodynamicists had\\n theorized\\u2014was no more than a pattern in emptiness....\\n\\n\\n But a pattern which I could duplicate, now that I had seen what had\\n been done to me.\\n\\n\\n Hesitantly, I felt for the immaterial fabric of the continuum, warping\\n and manipulating it, copying the Gool probe. Like planes of paper-thin\\n crystal, the polyfinite aspects of reality shifted into focus, aligning\\n themselves.\\n\\n\\n Abruptly, a channel lay open. As easily as I would stretch out my hand\\n to pluck a moth from a night-flower, I reached across the unimaginable\\n void\\u2014and sensed a pit blacker than the bottom floor of hell, and a\\n glistening dark shape.\\n\\n\\n There was a soundless shriek. \\\"\\nEffulgence! It reached out\\u2014touched\\n me!\\n\\\"\\nUsing the technique I had grasped from the Gool itself, I struck,\\n stifling the outcry, invaded the fetid blackness and grappled the\\n obscene gelatinous immensity of the Gool spy as it spasmed in a frenzy\\n of xenophobia\\u2014a ton of liver writhing at the bottom of a dark well.\\n\\n\\n I clamped down control. The Gool mind folded in on itself, gibbering.\\n Not pausing to rest, I followed up, probed along my channel of contact,\\n tracing patterns, scanning the flaccid Gool mind....\\n\\n\\n I saw a world of yellow seas lapping at endless shores of mud. There\\n was a fuming pit, where liquid sulphur bubbled up from some inner\\n source, filling an immense natural basin. The Gool clustered at its\\n rim, feeding, each monstrous shape heaving against its neighbors for a\\n more favorable position.\\nI probed farther, saw the great cables of living nervous tissue that\\n linked each eating organ with the brain-mass far underground. I traced\\n the passages through which tendrils ran out to immense caverns where\\n smaller creatures labored over strange devices. These, my host's memory\\n told me, were the young of the Gool. Here they built the fleets that\\n would transport the spawn to the new worlds the Prime Overlord had\\n discovered, worlds where food was free for the taking. Not sulphur\\n alone, but potassium, calcium, iron and all the metals\\u2014riches\\n beyond belief in endless profusion. No longer would the Gool tribe\\n cluster\\u2014those who remained of a once-great race\\u2014at a single feeding\\n trough. They would spread out across a galaxy\\u2014and beyond.\\n\\n\\n But not if I could help it.\\n\\n\\n The Gool had evolved a plan\\u2014but they'd had a stroke of bad luck.\\n\\n\\n In the past, they had managed to control a man here and there, among\\n the fleets, far from home, but only at a superficial level. Enough,\\n perhaps, to wreck a ship, but not the complete control needed to send a\\n man back to Earth under Gool compulsion, to carry out complex sabotage.\\n\\n\\n Then they had found me, alone, a sole survivor, free from the clutter\\n of the other mind-fields. It had been their misfortune to pick a\\n psychodynamicist. Instead of gaining a patient slave, they had opened\\n the fortress door to an unseen spy. Now that I was there, I would see\\n what I could steal.\\n\\n\\n A timeless time passed. I wandered among patterns of white light and\\n white sound, plumbed the deepest recesses of hidden Gool thoughts,\\n fared along strange ways examining the shapes and colors of the\\n concepts of an alien mind.\\n\\n\\n I paused at last, scanning a multi-ordinal structure of pattern within\\n pattern; the diagrammed circuits of a strange machine.\\n\\n\\n I followed through its logic-sequence; and, like a bomb-burst, its\\n meaning exploded in my mind.\\n\\n\\n From the vile nest deep under the dark surface of the Gool world in\\n its lonely trans-Plutonian orbit, I had plucked the ultimate secret of\\n their kind.\\n\\n\\n Matter across space.\\n\\\"You've got to listen to me, Kayle,\\\" I shouted. \\\"I know you think I'm\\n a Gool robot. But what I have is too big to let you blow it up without\\n a fight. Matter transmission! You know what that can mean to us. The\\n concept is too complex to try to describe in words. You'll have to take\\n my word for it. I can build it, though, using standard components, plus\\n an infinite-area antenna and a moebius-wound coil\\u2014and a few other\\n things....\\\"\\n\\n\\n I harangued Kayle for a while, and then sweated out his answer. I was\\n getting close now. If he couldn't see the beauty of my proposal, my\\n screens would start to register the radiation of warheads any time now.\\n\\n\\n Kayle came back\\u2014and his answer boiled down to \\\"no.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I tried to reason with him. I reminded him how I had readied myself\\n for the trip with sessions on the encephaloscope, setting up the\\n cross-networks of conditioned defensive responses, the shunt circuits\\n to the decoy pseudo-personality, leaving my volitional ego free. I\\n talked about subliminal hypnotics and the resilience quotient of the\\n ego-complex.\\n\\n\\n I might have saved my breath.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I don't understand that psychodynamics jargon, Granthan,\\\" he snapped.\\n \\\"It smacks of mysticism. But I understand what the Gool have done to\\n you well enough. I'm sorry.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I leaned back and chewed the inside of my lip and thought unkind\\n thoughts about Colonel Ausar Kayle. Then I settled down to solve the\\n problem at hand.\\n\\n\\n I keyed the chart file, flashed pages from the standard index on the\\n reference screen, checking radar coverages, beacon ranges, monitor\\n stations, controller fields. It looked as though a radar-negative boat\\n the size of mine might possibly get through the defensive net with a\\n daring pilot, and as a condemned spy, I could afford to be daring.\\n\\n\\n And I had a few ideas.\\nIII\\n\\n\\n The shrilling of the proximity alarm blasted through the silence. For a\\n wild moment I thought Kayle had beaten me to the punch; then I realized\\n it was the routine DEW line patrol contact.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Z four-oh-two, I am reading your IFF. Decelerate at 1.8 gee\\n preparatory to picking up approach orbit....\\\"\\n\\n\\n The screen went on droning out instructions. I fed them into the\\n autopilot, at the same time running over my approach plan. The scout\\n was moving in closer. I licked dry lips. It was time to try.\\n\\n\\n I closed my eyes, reached out\\u2014as the Gool mind had reached out to\\n me\\u2014and felt the touch of a Signals Officer's mind, forty thousand\\n miles distant, aboard the patrol vessel. There was a brief flurry of\\n struggle; then I dictated my instructions. The Signals Officer punched\\n keys, spoke into his microphone:\\n\\n\\n \\\"As you were, Z four-oh-two. Continue on present course. At Oh-nineteen\\n seconds, pick up planetary for re-entry and let-down.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I blanked out the man's recollection of what had happened, caught his\\n belated puzzlement as I broke contact.

Try to understand....\\\"\\n\\n\\n I flipped the switch, sat gripping the couch, my stomach rising with\\n each heave of the floating escape capsule. I had perhaps five minutes.\\n The missiles would be from Canaveral.\\n\\n\\n I closed my eyes, forced myself to relax, reached out....\\n\\n\\n I sensed the distant shore, the hot buzz of human minds at work in the\\n cities. I followed the coastline, found the Missile Base, flicked\\n through the cluster of minds.\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\u2014\\nmissile on course; do right, baby. That's it, right in the slot.\\n\\\"\\n\\n\\n I fingered my way through the man's mind and found the control centers.\\n He turned stiffly from the plotting board, tottered to a panel to slam\\n his hand against the destruct button.\\n\\n\\n Men fell on him, dragged him back. \\\"\\u2014\\nfool, why did you blow it?\\n\\\"\\n\\n\\n I dropped the contact, found another, who leaped to the panel,\\n detonated the remainder of the flight of six missiles. Then I withdrew.\\n I would have a few minutes' stay of execution now.\\n\\n\\n I was ten miles from shore. The capsule had its own power plant. I\\n started it up, switched on the external viewer. I saw dark sea, the\\n glint of star-light on the choppy surface, in the distance a glow on\\n the horizon that would be Key West. I plugged the course into the\\n pilot, then leaned back and felt outward with my mind for the next\\n attacker.\\nIV\\n\\n\\n It was dark in the trainyard. I moved along the tracks in a stumbling\\n walk. Just a few more minutes, I was telling myself.\\nA few more\\n minutes and you can lie down ... rest....\\nThe shadowed bulk of a box car loomed up, its open door a blacker\\n square. I leaned against the sill, breathing hard, then reached inside\\n for a grip with my good hand.\\n\\n\\n Gravel scrunched nearby. The beam of a flashlight lanced out, slipped\\n along the weathered car, caught me. There was a startled exclamation.\\n I ducked back, closed my eyes, felt out for his mind. There was a\\n confused murmur of thought, a random intrusion of impressions from the\\n city all around. It was hard, too hard. I had to sleep\\u2014\\n\\n\\n I heard the snick of a revolver being cocked, and dropped flat as a\\n gout of flame stabbed toward me, the imperative Bam! echoing between\\n the cars. I caught the clear thought:\\n\\n\\n \\\"God-awful looking, shaved head, arm stuck out; him all right\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n I reached out to his mind and struck at random. The light fell, went\\n out, and I heard the unconscious body slam to the ground like a poled\\n steer.\\n\\n\\n It was easy\\u2014if I could only stay awake.\\n\\n\\n I gritted my teeth, pulled myself into the car, crawled to a dark\\n corner behind a crate and slumped down. I tried to evoke a personality\\n fraction to set as a guard, a part of my mind to stay awake and warn\\n me of danger. It was too much trouble. I relaxed and let it all slide\\n down into darkness.\\nThe car swayed, click-clack, click-clack. I opened my eyes, saw yellow\\n sunlight in a bar across the litter on the floor. The power truss\\n creaked, pulling at my arm. My broken leg was throbbing its indignation\\n at the treatment it had received\\u2014walking brace and all\\u2014and the burned\\n arm was yelling aloud for more of that nice dope that had been keeping\\n it from realizing how bad it was. All things considered, I felt like a\\n badly embalmed mummy\\u2014except that I was hungry. I had been a fool not\\n to fill my pockets when I left the escape capsule in the shallows off\\n Key Largo, but things had been happening too fast.\\n\\n\\n I had barely made it to the fishing boat, whose owner I had coerced\\n into rendezvousing with me before shells started dropping around us. If\\n the gunners on the cruiser ten miles away had had any luck, they would\\n have finished me\\u2014and the hapless fisherman\\u2014right then. We rode out a\\n couple of near misses, before I put the cruiser's gunnery crew off the\\n air.\\n\\n\\n At a fishing camp on the beach, I found a car\\u2014with driver. He dropped\\n me at the railyard, and drove off under the impression he was in town\\n for groceries. He'd never believe he'd seen me.\\n\\n\\n Now I'd had my sleep. I had to start getting ready for the next act of\\n the farce.\\n\\n\\n I pressed the release on the power truss, gingerly unclamped it, then\\n rigged a sling from a strip of shirt tail. I tied the arm to my side as\\n inconspicuously as possible. I didn't disturb the bandages.\\n\\n\\n I needed new clothes\\u2014or at least different ones\\u2014and something to\\n cover my shaved skull. I couldn't stay hidden forever. The yard cop had\\n recognized me at a glance.\\n\\n\\n I lay back, waiting for the train to slow for a town. I wasn't unduly\\n worried\\u2014at the moment. The watchman probably hadn't convinced anyone\\n he'd actually seen me. Maybe he hadn't been too sure himself.\\n\\n\\n The click-clack slowed and the train shuddered to a stop. I crept to\\n the door, peered through the crack. There were sunny fields, a few low\\n buildings in the distance, the corner of a platform. I closed my eyes\\n and let my awareness stretch out.\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\u2014\\nlousy job. What's the use? Little witch in the lunch room ... up in\\n the hills, squirrel hunting, bottle of whiskey....\\n\\\"\\n\\n\\n I settled into control gently, trying not to alarm the man. I saw\\n through his eyes the dusty box car, the rust on the tracks, the\\n listless weeds growing among cinders, and the weathered boards of\\n the platform. I turned him, and saw the dingy glass of the telegraph\\n window, a sagging screen door with a chipped enameled cola sign.\\n\\n\\n I walked the man to the door, and through it. Behind a linoleum-topped\\n counter, a coarse-skinned teen-age girl with heavy breasts and wet\\n patches under her arms looked up without interest as the door banged.\\n\\n\\n My host went on to the counter, gestured toward the waxed-paper-wrapped\\n sandwiches under a glass cover. \\\"I'll take 'em all. And candy bars, and\\n cigarettes. And give me a big glass of water.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Better git out there and look after yer train,\\\" the girl said\\n carelessly. \\\"When'd you git so all-fired hungry all of a sudden?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Put it in a bag. Quick.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Look who's getting bossy\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n My host rounded the counter, picked up a used paper bag, began stuffing\\n food in it. The girl stared at him, then pushed him back. \\\"You git back\\n around that counter!\\\"\\n\\n\\n She filled the bag, took a pencil from behind her ear.\\n\\n\\n \\\"That'll be one eighty-five. Cash.\\\"\\n\\n\\n My host took two dog-eared bills from his shirt pocket, dropped them\\n on the counter and waited while the girl filled a glass. He picked it\\n up and started out.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Hey! Where you goin' with my glass?\\\"\\n\\n\\n The trainman crossed the platform, headed for the boxcar. He slid the\\n loose door back a few inches against the slack latch, pushed the bag\\n inside, placed the glass of water beside it, then pulled off his grimy\\n railroader's cap and pushed it through the opening. He turned. The girl\\n watched from the platform. A rattle passed down the line and the train\\n started up with a lurch. The man walked back toward the girl. I heard\\n him say: \\\"Friend o' mine in there\\u2014just passin' through.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I was discovering that it wasn't necessary to hold tight control over\\n every move of a subject. Once given the impulse to act, he would\\n rationalize his behavior, fill in the details\\u2014and never know that the\\n original idea hadn't been his own.\\n\\n\\n I drank the water first, ate a sandwich, then lit a cigarette and lay\\n back. So far so good. The crates in the car were marked \\\"U. S. Naval\\n Aerospace Station, Bayou Le Cochon\\\". With any luck I'd reach New\\n Orleans in another twelve hours. The first step of my plan included a\\n raid on the Delta National Labs; but that was tomorrow. That could\\n wait.\\nIt was a little before dawn when I crawled out of the car at a siding\\n in the swampy country a few miles out of New Orleans. I wasn't feeling\\n good, but I had a stake in staying on my feet. I still had a few miles\\n in me. I had my supplies\\u2014a few candy bars and some cigarettes\\u2014stuffed\\n in the pockets of the tattered issue coverall. Otherwise, I was\\n unencumbered. Unless you wanted to count the walking brace on my right\\n leg and the sling binding my arm.\\n\\n\\n I picked my way across mushy ground to a pot-holed black-top road,\\n started limping toward a few car lights visible half a mile away. It\\n was already hot. The swamp air was like warmed-over subway fumes.\\n Through the drugs, I could feel my pulse throbbing in my various\\n wounds. I reached out and touched the driver's mind; he was thinking\\n about shrimps, a fish-hook wound on his left thumb and a girl with\\n black hair. \\\"Want a lift?\\\" he called.\\n\\n\\n I thanked him and got in. He gave me a glance and I pinched off his\\n budding twinge of curiosity. It was almost an effort now not to follow\\n his thoughts. It was as though my mind, having learned the trick of\\n communications with others, instinctively reached out toward them.\\n\\n\\n An hour later he dropped me on a street corner in a shabby marketing\\n district of the city and drove off. I hoped he made out all right with\\n the dark-haired girl. I spotted a used-clothing store and headed for it.\\n\\n\\n Twenty minutes later I was back on the sidewalk, dressed in a\\n pinkish-gray suit that had been cut a long time ago by a Latin\\n tailor\\u2014maybe to settle a grudge. The shirt that went with it was\\n an unsuccessful violet. The black string tie lent a dubious air of\\n distinction. I'd swapped the railroader's cap for a tarnished beret.\\n The man who had supplied the outfit was still asleep. I figured\\n I'd done him a favor by taking it. I couldn't hope to pass for a\\n fisherman\\u2014I wasn't the type. Maybe I'd get by as a coffee-house\\n derelict.\\n\\n\\n I walked past fly-covered fish stalls, racks of faded garments, grimy\\n vegetables in bins, enough paint-flaked wrought iron to cage a herd of\\n brontosauri, and fetched up at a cab stand. I picked a fat driver with\\n a wart.\\n\\n\\n \\\"How much to the Delta National Laboratories?\\\"\\n\\n\\n He rolled an eye toward me, shifted his toothpick.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What ya wanna go out there for? Nothing out there.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'm a tourist,\\\" I said. \\\"They told me before I left home not to miss\\n it.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He grunted, reached back and opened the door. I got in. He flipped his\\n flag down, started up with a clash of gears and pulled out without\\n looking.\\n\\n\\n \\\"How far is it?\\\" I asked him.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It ain't far. Mile, mile and a quarter.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Pretty big place, I guess.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He didn't answer.\\n\\n\\n We went through a warehousing district, swung left along the\\n waterfront, bumped over railroad tracks, and pulled up at a nine-foot\\n cyclone fence with a locked gate.\\n\\n\\n \\\"A buck ten,\\\" my driver said.\\n\\n\\n I looked out at the fence, a barren field, a distant group of low\\n buildings. \\\"What's this?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"This is the place you ast for. That'll be a buck ten, mister.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I touched his mind, planted a couple of false impressions and withdrew.\\n He blinked, then started up, drove around the field, pulled up at an\\n open gate with a blue-uniformed guard. He looked back at me.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You want I should drive in, sir?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'll get out here.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He jumped out, opened my door, helped me out with a hand under my good\\n elbow. \\\"I'll get your change, sir,\\\" he said, reaching for his hip.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Keep it.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Thank YOU.\\\" He hesitated. \\\"Maybe I oughta stick around. You know.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'll be all right.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I hope so,\\\" he said. \\\"A man like you\\u2014you and me\\u2014\\\" he winked. \\\"After\\n all, we ain't both wearing berets fer nothing.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"True,\\\" I said. \\\"Consider your tip doubled.
