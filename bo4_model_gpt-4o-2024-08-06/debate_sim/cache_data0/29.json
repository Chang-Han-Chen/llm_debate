Happy\\n about it? Lucky you!\\nFrank Pembroke\\n sat behind\\n the desk of his shabby\\n little office over Lemark's Liquors\\n in downtown Los Angeles and\\n waited for his first customer. He\\n had been in business for a week\\n and as yet had had no callers.\\n Therefore, it was with a mingled\\n sense of excitement and satisfaction\\n that he greeted the tall,\\n dark, smooth-faced figure that\\n came up the stairs and into the\\n office shortly before noon.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Good day, sir,\\\" said Pembroke\\n with an amiable smile. \\\"I\\n see my advertisement has interested\\n you. Please stand in that\\n corner for just a moment.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Opening the desk drawer,\\n which was almost empty, Pembroke\\n removed an automatic pistol\\n fitted with a silencer. Pointing\\n it at the amazed customer, he\\n fired four .22 caliber longs into\\n the narrow chest. Then he made\\n a telephone call and sat down to\\n wait. He wondered how long it\\n would be before his next client\\n would arrive.\\nThe series of events leading up\\n to Pembroke's present occupation\\n had commenced on a dismal,\\n overcast evening in the South\\n Pacific a year earlier. Bound for\\n Sydney, two days out of Valparaiso,\\n the Colombian tramp\\n steamer\\nElena Mia\\nhad encountered\\n a dense greenish fog which\\n seemed vaguely redolent of citrus\\n trees. Standing on the forward\\n deck, Pembroke was one of the\\n first to perceive the peculiar odor\\n and to spot the immense gray\\n hulk wallowing in the murky distance.\\n\\n\\n Then the explosion had come,\\n from far below the waterline,\\n and the decks were awash with\\n frantic crewmen, officers, and the\\n handful of passengers. Only two\\n lifeboats were launched before\\n the\\nElena Mia\\nwent down. Pembroke\\n was in the second. The\\n roar of the sinking ship was the\\n last thing he heard for some\\n time.\\n\\n\\n Pembroke came as close to being\\n a professional adventurer as\\n one can in these days of regimented\\n travel, organized peril,\\n and political restriction. He had\\n made for himself a substantial\\n fortune through speculation in a\\n great variety of properties, real\\n and otherwise. Life had given\\n him much and demanded little,\\n which was perhaps the reason\\n for his restiveness.\\nLoyalty to person or to people\\n was a trait Pembroke had never\\n recognized in himself, nor had it\\n ever been expected of him. And\\n yet he greatly envied those\\n staunch patriots and lovers who\\n could find it in themselves to\\n elevate the glory and safety of\\n others above that of themselves.\\n\\n\\n Lacking such loyalties, Pembroke\\n adapted quickly to the situation\\n in which he found himself\\n when he regained consciousness.\\n He awoke in a small room in\\n what appeared to be a typical\\n modern American hotel. The wallet\\n in his pocket contained exactly\\n what it should, approximately\\n three hundred dollars.\\n His next thought was of food.\\n He left the room and descended\\n via the elevator to the restaurant.\\n Here he observed that it\\n was early afternoon. Ordering\\n a full dinner, for he was unusually\\n hungry, he began to study the\\n others in the restaurant.\\n\\n\\n Many of the faces seemed familiar;\\n the crew of the ship,\\n probably. He also recognized several\\n of the passengers. However,\\n he made no attempt to speak to\\n them. After his meal, he bought\\n a good corona and went for a\\n walk. His situation could have\\n been any small western American\\n seacoast city. He heard the hiss\\n of the ocean in the direction the\\n afternoon sun was taking. In his\\n full-gaited walk, he was soon approaching\\n the beach.\\n\\n\\n On the sand he saw a number\\n of sun bathers. One in particular,\\n an attractive woman of about\\n thirty, tossed back her long,\\n chestnut locks and gazed up intently\\n at Pembroke as he passed.\\n Seldom had he enjoyed so ingenuous\\n an invitation. He halted\\n and stared down at her for a few\\n moments.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You are looking for someone?\\\"\\n she inquired.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Much of the time,\\\" said the\\n man.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Could it be me?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It could be.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yet you seem unsure,\\\" she\\n said.\\n\\n\\n Pembroke smiled, uneasily.\\n There was something not entirely\\n normal about her conversation.\\n Though the rest of her compensated\\n for that.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Tell me what's wrong with\\n me,\\\" she went on urgently. \\\"I'm\\n not good enough, am I? I mean,\\n there's something wrong with\\n the way I look or act. Isn't there?\\n Please help me, please!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You're not casual enough, for\\n one thing,\\\" said Pembroke, deciding\\n to play along with her for\\n the moment. \\\"You're too tense.\\n Also you're a bit knock-kneed,\\n not that it matters. Is that what\\n you wanted to hear?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes, yes\\u2014I mean, I suppose\\n so. I can try to be more casual.\\n But I don't know what to do\\n about my knees,\\\" she said wistfully,\\n staring across at the\\n smooth, tan limbs. \\\"Do you think\\n I'm okay otherwise? I mean, as a\\n whole I'm not so bad, am I? Oh,\\n please tell me.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"How about talking it over at\\n supper tonight?\\\" Pembroke proposed.\\n \\\"Maybe with less distraction\\n I'll have a better picture of\\n you\\u2014as a whole.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, that's very generous of\\n you,\\\" the woman told him. She\\n scribbled a name and an address\\n on a small piece of paper and\\n handed it to him. \\\"Any time\\n after six,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\n Pembroke left the beach and\\n walked through several small\\n specialty shops. He tried to get\\n the woman off his mind, but the\\n oddness of her conversation continued\\n to bother him. She was\\n right about being different, but\\n it was her concern about being\\n different that made her so. How\\n to explain\\nthat\\nto her?\\nThen he saw the weird little\\n glass statuette among the usual\\n bric-a-brac. It rather resembled\\n a ground hog, had seven fingers\\n on each of its six limbs, and\\n smiled up at him as he stared.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Can I help you, sir?\\\" a middle-aged\\n saleswoman inquired.\\n \\\"Oh, good heavens, whatever is\\n that thing doing here?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Pembroke watched with lifted\\n eyebrows as the clerk whisked\\n the bizarre statuette underneath\\n the counter.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What the hell was that?\\\"\\n Pembroke demanded.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, you know\\u2014or don't you?\\n Oh, my,\\\" she concluded, \\\"are you\\n one of the\\u2014strangers?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"And if I were?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, I'd certainly appreciate\\n it if you'd tell me how I walk.\\\"\\nShe came around in front of\\n the counter and strutted back\\n and forth a few times.\\n\\n\\n \\\"They tell me I lean too far\\n forward,\\\" she confided. \\\"But I\\n should think you'd fall down if\\n you didn't.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Don't try to go so fast and\\n you won't fall down,\\\" suggested\\n Pembroke. \\\"You're in too much\\n of a hurry. Also those fake flowers\\n on your blouse make you look\\n frumpy.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, I'm supposed to look\\n frumpy,\\\" the woman retorted.\\n \\\"That's the type of person I am.\\n But you can look frumpy and still\\n walk natural, can't you? Everyone\\n says you can.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, they've got a point,\\\"\\n said Pembroke. \\\"Incidentally,\\n just where are we, anyway?\\n What city is this?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Puerto Pacifico,\\\" she told\\n him. \\\"Isn't that a lovely name?\\n It means peaceful port. In Spanish.\\\"\\n\\n\\n That was fine. At least he now\\n knew where he was. But as he\\n left the shop he began checking\\n off every west coast state, city,\\n town, and inlet. None, to the best\\n of his knowledge, was called\\n Puerto Pacifico.\\n\\n\\n He headed for the nearest\\n service station and asked for a\\n map. The attendant gave him one\\n which showed the city, but nothing\\n beyond.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Which way is it to San Francisco?\\\"\\n asked Pembroke.\\n\\n\\n \\\"That all depends on where\\n you are,\\\" the boy returned.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Okay, then where am I?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Pardon me, there's a customer,\\\"\\n the boy said. \\\"This is\\n Puerto Pacifico.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Pembroke watched him hurry\\n off to service a car with a sense\\n of having been given the runaround.\\n To his surprise, the boy\\n came back a few minutes later\\n after servicing the automobile.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Say, I've just figured out who\\n you are,\\\" the youngster told him.\\n \\\"I'd sure appreciate it if you'd\\n give me a little help on my lingo.\\n Also, you gas up the car first,\\n then try to sell 'em the oil\\u2014right?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Right,\\\" said Pembroke wearily.\\n \\\"What's wrong with your\\n lingo? Other than the fact that\\n it's not colloquial enough.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Not enough slang, huh? Well,\\n I guess I'll have to concentrate\\n on that. How about the smile?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Perfect,\\\" Pembroke told him.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yeah?\\\" said the boy delightedly.\\n \\\"Say, come back again,\\n huh? I sure appreciate the help.\\n Keep the map.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Thanks. One more thing,\\\"\\n Pembroke said. \\\"What's over\\n that way\\u2014outside the city?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Sand.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"How about that way?\\\" he\\n asked, pointing north. \\\"And that\\n way?\\\" pointing south.\\n\\n\\n \\\"More of the same.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Any railroads?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"That we ain't got.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Buses? Airlines?\\\"\\n\\n\\n The kid shook his head.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Some city.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yeah, it's kinda isolated. A\\n lot of ships dock here, though.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"All cargo ships, I'll bet. No\\n passengers,\\\" said Pembroke.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Right,\\\" said the attendant,\\n giving with his perfect smile.\\n\\n\\n \\\"No getting out of here, is\\n there?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's for sure,\\\" the boy said,\\n walking away to wait on another\\n customer. \\\"If you don't like the\\n place, you've had it.\\\"\\nPembroke returned to the\\n hotel. Going to the bar, he recognized\\n one of the\\nElena Mia's\\npaying\\n passengers. He was a short,\\n rectangular little man in his fifties\\n named Spencer. He sat in a\\n booth with three young women,\\n all lovely, all effusive. The topic\\n of the conversation turned out\\n to be precisely what Pembroke\\n had predicted.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, Louisa, I'd say your\\n only fault is the way you keep\\n wigglin' your shoulders up 'n'\\n down. Why'n'sha try holdin' 'em\\n straight?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I thought it made me look\\n sexy,\\\" the redhead said petulantly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Just be yourself, gal,\\\" Spencer\\n drawled, jabbing her intimately\\n with a fat elbow, \\\"and\\n you'll qualify.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Me, me,\\\" the blonde with a\\n feather cut was insisting. \\\"What\\n is wrong with me?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You're perfect, sweetheart,\\\"\\n he told her, taking her hand.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ah, come on,\\\" she pleaded.\\n \\\"Everyone tells me I chew gum\\n with my mouth open. Don't you\\n hate that?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Naw, that's part of your\\n charm,\\\" Spencer assured her.\\n\\n\\n \\\"How 'bout me, sugar,\\\" asked\\n the girl with the coal black hair.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ah, you're perfect, too. You\\n are all perfect. I've never seen\\n such a collection of dolls as parade\\n around this here city.\\n C'mon, kids\\u2014how 'bout another\\n round?\\\"\\n\\n\\n But the dolls had apparently\\n lost interest in him. They got up\\n one by one and walked out of the\\n bar. Pembroke took his rum and\\n tonic and moved over to Spencer's\\n booth.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Okay if I join you?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Sure,\\\" said the fat man.\\n \\\"Wonder what the hell got into\\n those babes?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You said they were perfect.\\n They know they're not. You've\\n got to be rough with them in this\\n town,\\\" said Pembroke. \\\"That's\\n all they want from us.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Mister, you've been doing\\n some thinkin', I can see,\\\" said\\n Spencer, peering at him suspiciously.\\n \\\"Maybe you've figured\\n out where we are.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Your bet's as good as mine,\\\"\\n said Pembroke. \\\"It's not Wellington,\\n and it's not Brisbane, and\\n it's not Long Beach, and it's not\\n Tahiti. There are a lot of places\\n it's not. But where the hell it is,\\n you tell me.\\n\\n\\n \\\"And, by the way,\\\" he added,\\n \\\"I hope you like it in Puerto\\n Pacifico. Because there isn't any\\n place to go from here and there\\n isn't any way to get there if\\n there were.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Pardon me, gentlemen, but\\n I'm Joe Valencia, manager of the\\n hotel. I would be very grateful if\\n you would give me a few minutes\\n of honest criticism.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ah, no, not you, too,\\\" groaned\\n Spencer. \\\"Look, Joe, what's\\n the gag?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You are newcomers, Mr.\\n Spencer,\\\" Valencia explained.\\n \\\"You are therefore in an excellent\\n position to point out our\\n faults as you see them.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, so what?\\\" demanded\\n Spencer. \\\"I've got more important\\n things to do than to worry\\n about your troubles. You look\\n okay to me.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Mr. Valencia,\\\" said Pembroke.\\n \\\"I've noticed that you\\n walk with a very slight limp. If\\n you have a bad leg, I should\\n think you would do better to develop\\n a more pronounced limp.\\n Otherwise, you may appear to\\n be self-conscious about it.\\\"\\nSpencer opened his mouth to\\n protest, but saw with amazement\\n that it was exactly this that\\n Valencia was seeking. Pembroke\\n was amused at his companion's\\n reaction but observed that Spencer\\n still failed to see the point.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Also, there is a certain effeminateness\\n in the way in which\\n you speak,\\\" said Pembroke. \\\"Try\\n to be a little more direct, a little\\n more brusque. Speak in a monotone.\\n It will make you more acceptable.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Thank you so much,\\\" said the\\n manager. \\\"There is much food\\n for thought in what you have\\n said, Mr. Pembroke. However,\\n Mr. Spencer, your value has failed\\n to prove itself. You have only\\n yourself to blame. Cooperation is\\n all we require of you.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Valencia left. Spencer ordered\\n another martini. Neither he nor\\n Pembroke spoke for several minutes.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Somebody's crazy around\\n here,\\\" the fat man muttered\\n after a few moments. \\\"Is it me,\\n Frank?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"No. You just don't belong\\n here, in this particular place,\\\"\\n said Pembroke thoughtfully.\\n \\\"You're the wrong type. But they\\n couldn't know that ahead of time.\\n The way they operate it's a\\n pretty hit-or-miss operation. But\\n they don't care one bit about us,\\n Spencer. Consider the men who\\n went down with the ship. That\\n was just part of the game.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"What the hell are you sayin'?\\\"\\n asked Spencer in disbelief.\\n \\\"You figure\\nthey\\nsunk the ship?\\n Valencia and the waitress and\\n the three babes? Ah, come on.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It's what you think that will\\n determine what you do, Spencer.\\n I suggest you change your attitude;\\n play along with them for a\\n few days till the picture becomes\\n a little clearer to you. We'll talk\\n about it again then.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Pembroke rose and started out\\n of the bar. A policeman entered\\n and walked directly to Spencer's\\n table. Loitering at the juke box,\\n Pembroke overheard the conversation.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You Spencer?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's right,\\\" said the fat\\n man sullenly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What don't you like about\\n me? The\\ntruth\\n, buddy.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ah, hell! Nothin' wrong\\n with you at all, and nothin'll\\n make me say there is,\\\" said Spencer.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You're the guy, all right. Too\\n bad, Mac,\\\" said the cop.\\n\\n\\n Pembroke heard the shots as\\n he strolled casually out into the\\n brightness of the hotel lobby.\\n While he waited for the elevator,\\n he saw them carrying the body\\n into the street. How many others,\\n he wondered, had gone out on\\n their backs during their first day\\n in Puerto Pacifico?\\nPembroke shaved, showered,\\n and put on the new suit and shirt\\n he had bought. Then he took\\n Mary Ann, the woman he had\\n met on the beach, out to dinner.\\n She would look magnificent even\\n when fully clothed, he decided,\\n and the pale chartreuse gown she\\n wore hardly placed her in that\\n category. Her conversation seemed\\n considerably more normal\\n after the other denizens of\\n Puerto Pacifico Pembroke had\\n listened to that afternoon.\\n\\n\\n After eating they danced for\\n an hour, had a few more drinks,\\n then went to Pembroke's room.\\n He still knew nothing about her\\n and had almost exhausted his\\n critical capabilities, but not once\\n had she become annoyed with\\n him. She seemed to devour every\\n factual point of imperfection\\n about herself that Pembroke\\n brought to her attention. And,\\n fantastically enough, she actually\\n appeared to have overcome every\\n little imperfection he had been\\n able to communicate to her.\\n\\n\\n It was in the privacy of his\\n room that Pembroke became\\n aware of just how perfect, physically,\\n Mary Ann was. Too perfect.\\n No freckles or moles anywhere\\n on the visible surface of\\n her brown skin, which was more\\n than a mere sampling. Furthermore,\\n her face and body were\\n meticulously symmetrical. And\\n she seemed to be wholly ambidextrous.\\n\\n\\n \\\"With so many beautiful\\n women in Puerto Pacifico,\\\" said\\n Pembroke probingly, \\\"I find it\\n hard to understand why there are\\n so few children.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes, children are decorative,\\n aren't they,\\\" said Mary Ann. \\\"I\\n do wish there were more of\\n them.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Why not have a couple of\\n your own?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, they're only given to maternal\\n types. I'd never get one.\\n Anyway, I won't ever marry,\\\"\\n she said. \\\"I'm the paramour\\n type.\\\"\\n\\n\\n It was obvious that the liquor\\n had been having some effect.\\n Either that, or she had a basic\\n flaw of loquacity that no one else\\n had discovered. Pembroke decided\\n he would have to cover his\\n tracks carefully.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What type am I?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Silly, you're real. You're not\\n a type at all.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Mary Ann, I love you very\\n much,\\\" Pembroke murmured,\\n gambling everything on this one\\n throw. \\\"When you go to Earth\\n I'll miss you terribly.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, but you'll be dead by\\n then,\\\" she pouted. \\\"So I mustn't\\n fall in love with you. I don't want\\n to be miserable.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"If I pretended I was one of\\n you, if I left on the boat with\\n you, they'd let me go to Earth\\n with you. Wouldn't they?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, yes, I'm sure they would.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Mary Ann, you have two\\n other flaws I feel I should mention.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes? Please tell me.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"In the first place,\\\" said Pembroke,\\n \\\"you should be willing to\\n fall in love with me even if it\\n will eventually make you unhappy.\\n How can you be the paramour\\n type if you refuse to fall in\\n love foolishly? And when you\\n have fallen in love, you should be\\n very loyal.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'll try,\\\" she said unsurely.\\n \\\"What else?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"The other thing is that, as\\n my mistress, you must never\\n mention me to anyone. It would\\n place me in great danger.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'll never tell anyone anything\\n about you,\\\" she promised.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Now try to love me,\\\" Pembroke\\n said, drawing her into his\\n arms and kissing with little\\n pleasure the smooth, warm perfection\\n of her tanned cheeks.\\n \\\"Love me my sweet, beautiful,\\n affectionate Mary Ann. My paramour.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Making love to Mary Ann was\\n something short of ecstasy. Not\\n for any obvious reason, but because\\n of subtle little factors that\\n make a woman a woman. Mary\\n Ann had no pulse. Mary Ann did\\n not perspire. Mary Ann did not\\n fatigue gradually but all at once.\\n Mary Ann breathed regularly\\n under all circumstances. Mary\\n Ann talked and talked and talked.\\n But then, Mary Ann was not\\n a human being.\\n\\n\\n When she left the hotel at midnight,\\n Pembroke was quite sure\\n that she understood his plan and\\n that she was irrevocably in love\\n with him. Tomorrow might bring\\n his death, but it might also ensure\\n his escape. After forty-two\\n years of searching for a passion,\\n for a cause, for a loyalty, Frank\\n Pembroke had at last found his.\\n Earth and the human race that\\n peopled it. And Mary Ann would\\n help him to save it.\\nThe next morning Pembroke\\n talked to Valencia about hunting.\\n He said that he planned to go\\n shooting out on the desert which\\n surrounded the city. Valencia\\n told him that there were no living\\n creatures anywhere but in\\n the city. Pembroke said he was\\n going out anyway.\\n\\n\\n He picked up Mary Ann at her\\n apartment and together they\\n went to a sporting goods store.\\n As he guessed there was a goodly\\n selection of firearms, despite the\\n fact that there was nothing to\\n hunt and only a single target\\n range within the city. Everything,\\n of course, had to be just\\n like Earth. That, after all, was\\n the purpose of Puerto Pacifico.\\n\\n\\n By noon they had rented a\\n jeep and were well away from\\n the city. Pembroke and Mary\\n Ann took turns firing at the paper\\n targets they had purchased. At\\n twilight they headed back to the\\n city. On the outskirts, where the\\n sand and soil were mixed and no\\n footprints would be left, Pembroke\\n hopped off. Mary Ann\\n would go straight to the police\\n and report that Pembroke had attacked\\n her and that she had shot\\n him. If necessary, she would conduct\\n the authorities to the place\\n where they had been target\\n shooting, but would be unable to\\n locate the spot where she had\\n buried the body. Why had she\\n buried it? Because at first she\\n was not going to report the incident.\\n She was frightened. It\\n was not airtight, but there would\\n probably be no further investigation.\\n And they certainly would\\n not prosecute Mary Ann for killing\\n an Earthman.\\n\\n\\n Now Pembroke had himself to\\n worry about. The first step was\\n to enter smoothly into the new\\n life he had planned. It wouldn't\\n be so comfortable as the previous\\n one, but should be considerably\\n safer. He headed slowly for the\\n \\\"old\\\" part of town, aging his\\n clothes against buildings and\\n fences as he walked. He had already\\n torn the collar of the shirt\\n and discarded his belt. By morning\\n his beard would grow to\\n blacken his face. And he would\\n look weary and hungry and aimless.\\n Only the last would be a deception.\\nTwo weeks later Pembroke\\n phoned Mary Ann. The police\\n had accepted her story without\\n even checking. And when, when\\n would she be seeing him again?\\n He had aroused her passion and\\n no amount of long-distance love\\n could requite it. Soon, he assured\\n her, soon.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Because, after all, you do owe\\n me something,\\\" she added.\\n\\n\\n And that was bad because it\\n sounded as if she had been giving\\n some womanly thought to the situation.\\n A little more of that and\\n she might go to the police again,\\n this time for vengeance.\\n\\n\\n Twice during his wanderings\\n Pembroke had seen the corpses\\n of Earthmen being carted out of\\n buildings. They had to be Earthmen\\n because they bled. Mary Ann\\n had admitted that she did not.\\n There would be very few Earthmen\\n left in Puerto Pacifico, and\\n it would be simple enough to locate\\n him if he were reported as\\n being on the loose. There was\\n no out but to do away with Mary\\n Ann.\\n\\n\\n Pembroke headed for the\\n beach. He knew she invariably\\n went there in the afternoon. He\\n loitered around the stalls where\\n hot dogs and soft drinks were\\n sold, leaning against a post in\\n the hot sun, hat pulled down over\\n his forehead. Then he noticed\\n that people all about him were\\n talking excitedly. They were discussing\\n a ship. It was leaving\\n that afternoon. Anyone who\\n could pass the interview would\\n be sent to Earth.\\n\\n\\n Pembroke had visited the\\n docks every day, without being\\n able to learn when the great\\n exodus would take place. Yet he\\n was certain the first lap would be\\n by water rather than by spaceship,\\n since no one he had talked\\n to in the city had ever heard of\\n spaceships. In fact, they knew\\n very little about their masters.\\n\\n\\n Now the ship had arrived and\\n was to leave shortly. If there was\\n any but the most superficial examination,\\n Pembroke would no\\n doubt be discovered and exterminated.\\n But since no one seemed\\n concerned about anything but his\\n own speech and behavior, he assumed\\n that they had all qualified\\n in every other respect. The reason\\n for transporting Earth People\\n to this planet was, of course,\\n to apply a corrective to any of\\n the Pacificos' aberrant mannerisms\\n or articulation. This was\\n the polishing up phase.\\nPembroke began hobbling toward\\n the docks. Almost at once\\n he found himself face to face\\n with Mary Ann. She smiled happily\\n when she recognized him.\\nThat\\nwas a good thing.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It is a sign of poor breeding\\n to smile at tramps,\\\" Pembroke\\n admonished her in a whisper.\\n \\\"Walk on ahead.\\\"\\n\\n\\n She obeyed. He followed. The\\n crowd grew thicker. They neared\\n the docks and Pembroke saw that\\n there were now set up on the\\n roped-off wharves small interviewing\\n booths. When it was\\n their turn, he and Mary Ann\\n each went into separate ones.\\n Pembroke found himself alone in\\n the little room.\\n\\n\\n Then he saw that there was\\n another entity in his presence\\n confined beneath a glass dome. It\\n looked rather like a groundhog\\n and had seven fingers on each of\\n its six limbs. But it was larger\\n and hairier than the glass one\\n he had seen at the gift store.\\n With four of its limbs it tapped\\n on an intricate keyboard in front\\n of it.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What is your name?\\\" queried\\n a metallic voice from a speaker\\n on the wall.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'm Jerry Newton. Got no\\n middle initial,\\\" Pembroke said in\\n a surly voice.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Occupation?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I work a lot o' trades. Fisherman,\\n fruit picker, fightin' range\\n fires, vineyards, car washer. Anything.\\n You name it. Been out of\\n work for a long time now,\\n though. Goin' on five months.\\n These here are hard times, no\\n matter what they say.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"What do you think of the\\n Chinese situation?\\\" the voice inquired.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Which situation's 'at?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Where's Seattle?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Seattle? State o' Washington.\\\"\\n\\n\\n And so it went for about five\\n minutes. Then he was told he\\n had qualified as a satisfactory\\n surrogate for a mid-twentieth\\n century American male, itinerant\\n type.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You understand your mission,\\n Newton?\\\" the voice asked. \\\"You\\n are to establish yourself on\\n Earth. In time you will receive\\n instructions. Then you will attack.\\n You will not see us, your\\n masters, again until the atmosphere\\n has been sufficiently chlorinated.\\n In the meantime, serve\\n us well.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He stumbled out toward the\\n docks, then looked about for\\n Mary Ann. He saw her at last\\n behind the ropes, her lovely face\\n in tears.\\n\\n\\n Then she saw him. Waving\\n frantically, she called his name\\n several times. Pembroke mingled\\n with the crowd moving toward\\n the ship, ignoring her. But still\\n the woman persisted in her\\n shouting.\\n\\n\\n Sidling up to a well-dressed\\n man-about-town type, Pembroke\\n winked at him and snickered.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You Frank?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Hell, no. But some poor\\n punk's sure red in the face, I'll\\n bet,\\\" the man-about-town said\\n with a chuckle. \\\"Those high-strung\\n paramour types always\\n raising a ruckus. They never do\\n pass the interview. Don't know\\n why they even make 'em.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Suddenly Mary Ann was quiet.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ambulance squad,\\\" Pembroke's\\n companion explained.\\n \\\"They'll take her off to the buggy\\n house for a few days and bring\\n her out fresh and ignorant as the\\n day she was assembled. Don't\\n know why they keep making 'em,\\n as I say. But I guess there's a\\n call for that type up there on\\n Earth.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yeah, I reckon there is at\\n that,\\\" said Pembroke, snickering\\n again as he moved away from the\\n other. \\\"And why not? Hey?\\n Why not?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Pembroke went right on hating\\n himself, however, till the\\n night he was deposited in a field\\n outside of Ensenada, broke but\\n happy, with two other itinerant\\n types. They separated in San\\n Diego, and it was not long before\\n Pembroke was explaining to the\\n police how he had drifted far\\n from the scene of the sinking of\\n the\\nElena Mia\\non a piece of\\n wreckage, and had been picked\\n up by a Chilean trawler. How he\\n had then made his way, with\\n much suffering, up the coast to\\n California. Two days later, his\\n identity established and his circumstances\\n again solvent, he was\\n headed for Los Angeles to begin\\n his save-Earth campaign.\\nNow, seated at his battered\\n desk in the shabby rented office\\n over Lemark's Liquors, Pembroke\\n gazed without emotion at\\n the two demolished Pacificos that\\n lay sprawled one atop the other\\n in the corner. His watch said\\n one-fifteen. The man from the\\n FBI should arrive soon.\\n\\n\\n There were footsteps on the\\n stairs for the third time that\\n day. Not the brisk, efficient steps\\n of a federal official, but the hesitant,\\n self-conscious steps of a\\n junior clerk type.\\n\\n\\n Pembroke rose as the young\\n man appeared at the door. His\\n face was smooth, unpimpled,\\n clean-shaven, without sweat on a\\n warm summer afternoon.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Are you Dr. Von Schubert?\\\"\\n the newcomer asked, peering into\\n the room. \\\"You see, I've got a\\n problem\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n The four shots from Pembroke's\\n pistol solved his problem\\n effectively. Pembroke tossed his\\n third victim onto the pile, then\\n opened a can of lager, quaffing\\n it appreciatively. Seating himself\\n once more, he leaned back in\\n the chair, both feet upon the\\n desk.\\n\\n\\n He would be out of business\\n soon, once the FBI agent had got\\n there. Pembroke was only in it to\\n get the proof he would need to\\n convince people of the truth of\\n his tale. But in the meantime he\\n allowed himself to admire the\\n clipping of the newspaper ad he\\n had run in all the Los Angeles\\n papers for the past week. The\\n little ad that had saved mankind\\n from God-knew-what insidious\\n menace. It read:\\nARE YOU IMPERFECT?\\nLET DR.

Happy\\n about it? Lucky you!\\nFrank Pembroke\\n sat behind\\n the desk of his shabby\\n little office over Lemark's Liquors\\n in downtown Los Angeles and\\n waited for his first customer. He\\n had been in business for a week\\n and as yet had had no callers.\\n Therefore, it was with a mingled\\n sense of excitement and satisfaction\\n that he greeted the tall,\\n dark, smooth-faced figure that\\n came up the stairs and into the\\n office shortly before noon.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Good day, sir,\\\" said Pembroke\\n with an amiable smile. \\\"I\\n see my advertisement has interested\\n you. Please stand in that\\n corner for just a moment.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Opening the desk drawer,\\n which was almost empty, Pembroke\\n removed an automatic pistol\\n fitted with a silencer. Pointing\\n it at the amazed customer, he\\n fired four .22 caliber longs into\\n the narrow chest. Then he made\\n a telephone call and sat down to\\n wait. He wondered how long it\\n would be before his next client\\n would arrive.\\nThe series of events leading up\\n to Pembroke's present occupation\\n had commenced on a dismal,\\n overcast evening in the South\\n Pacific a year earlier. Bound for\\n Sydney, two days out of Valparaiso,\\n the Colombian tramp\\n steamer\\nElena Mia\\nhad encountered\\n a dense greenish fog which\\n seemed vaguely redolent of citrus\\n trees. Standing on the forward\\n deck, Pembroke was one of the\\n first to perceive the peculiar odor\\n and to spot the immense gray\\n hulk wallowing in the murky distance.\\n\\n\\n Then the explosion had come,\\n from far below the waterline,\\n and the decks were awash with\\n frantic crewmen, officers, and the\\n handful of passengers. Only two\\n lifeboats were launched before\\n the\\nElena Mia\\nwent down. Pembroke\\n was in the second. The\\n roar of the sinking ship was the\\n last thing he heard for some\\n time.\\n\\n\\n Pembroke came as close to being\\n a professional adventurer as\\n one can in these days of regimented\\n travel, organized peril,\\n and political restriction. He had\\n made for himself a substantial\\n fortune through speculation in a\\n great variety of properties, real\\n and otherwise. Life had given\\n him much and demanded little,\\n which was perhaps the reason\\n for his restiveness.\\nLoyalty to person or to people\\n was a trait Pembroke had never\\n recognized in himself, nor had it\\n ever been expected of him. And\\n yet he greatly envied those\\n staunch patriots and lovers who\\n could find it in themselves to\\n elevate the glory and safety of\\n others above that of themselves.\\n\\n\\n Lacking such loyalties, Pembroke\\n adapted quickly to the situation\\n in which he found himself\\n when he regained consciousness.\\n He awoke in a small room in\\n what appeared to be a typical\\n modern American hotel. The wallet\\n in his pocket contained exactly\\n what it should, approximately\\n three hundred dollars.\\n His next thought was of food.\\n He left the room and descended\\n via the elevator to the restaurant.\\n Here he observed that it\\n was early afternoon. Ordering\\n a full dinner, for he was unusually\\n hungry, he began to study the\\n others in the restaurant.\\n\\n\\n Many of the faces seemed familiar;\\n the crew of the ship,\\n probably. He also recognized several\\n of the passengers. However,\\n he made no attempt to speak to\\n them. After his meal, he bought\\n a good corona and went for a\\n walk. His situation could have\\n been any small western American\\n seacoast city. He heard the hiss\\n of the ocean in the direction the\\n afternoon sun was taking. In his\\n full-gaited walk, he was soon approaching\\n the beach.\\n\\n\\n On the sand he saw a number\\n of sun bathers. One in particular,\\n an attractive woman of about\\n thirty, tossed back her long,\\n chestnut locks and gazed up intently\\n at Pembroke as he passed.\\n Seldom had he enjoyed so ingenuous\\n an invitation. He halted\\n and stared down at her for a few\\n moments.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You are looking for someone?\\\"\\n she inquired.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Much of the time,\\\" said the\\n man.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Could it be me?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It could be.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yet you seem unsure,\\\" she\\n said.\\n\\n\\n Pembroke smiled, uneasily.\\n There was something not entirely\\n normal about her conversation.\\n Though the rest of her compensated\\n for that.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Tell me what's wrong with\\n me,\\\" she went on urgently. \\\"I'm\\n not good enough, am I? I mean,\\n there's something wrong with\\n the way I look or act. Isn't there?\\n Please help me, please!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You're not casual enough, for\\n one thing,\\\" said Pembroke, deciding\\n to play along with her for\\n the moment. \\\"You're too tense.\\n Also you're a bit knock-kneed,\\n not that it matters. Is that what\\n you wanted to hear?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes, yes\\u2014I mean, I suppose\\n so. I can try to be more casual.\\n But I don't know what to do\\n about my knees,\\\" she said wistfully,\\n staring across at the\\n smooth, tan limbs. \\\"Do you think\\n I'm okay otherwise? I mean, as a\\n whole I'm not so bad, am I? Oh,\\n please tell me.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"How about talking it over at\\n supper tonight?\\\" Pembroke proposed.\\n \\\"Maybe with less distraction\\n I'll have a better picture of\\n you\\u2014as a whole.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, that's very generous of\\n you,\\\" the woman told him. She\\n scribbled a name and an address\\n on a small piece of paper and\\n handed it to him. \\\"Any time\\n after six,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\n Pembroke left the beach and\\n walked through several small\\n specialty shops. He tried to get\\n the woman off his mind, but the\\n oddness of her conversation continued\\n to bother him. She was\\n right about being different, but\\n it was her concern about being\\n different that made her so. How\\n to explain\\nthat\\nto her?\\nThen he saw the weird little\\n glass statuette among the usual\\n bric-a-brac. It rather resembled\\n a ground hog, had seven fingers\\n on each of its six limbs, and\\n smiled up at him as he stared.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Can I help you, sir?\\\" a middle-aged\\n saleswoman inquired.\\n \\\"Oh, good heavens, whatever is\\n that thing doing here?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Pembroke watched with lifted\\n eyebrows as the clerk whisked\\n the bizarre statuette underneath\\n the counter.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What the hell was that?\\\"\\n Pembroke demanded.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, you know\\u2014or don't you?\\n Oh, my,\\\" she concluded, \\\"are you\\n one of the\\u2014strangers?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"And if I were?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, I'd certainly appreciate\\n it if you'd tell me how I walk.\\\"\\nShe came around in front of\\n the counter and strutted back\\n and forth a few times.\\n\\n\\n \\\"They tell me I lean too far\\n forward,\\\" she confided. \\\"But I\\n should think you'd fall down if\\n you didn't.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Don't try to go so fast and\\n you won't fall down,\\\" suggested\\n Pembroke. \\\"You're in too much\\n of a hurry. Also those fake flowers\\n on your blouse make you look\\n frumpy.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, I'm supposed to look\\n frumpy,\\\" the woman retorted.\\n \\\"That's the type of person I am.\\n But you can look frumpy and still\\n walk natural, can't you? Everyone\\n says you can.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, they've got a point,\\\"\\n said Pembroke. \\\"Incidentally,\\n just where are we, anyway?\\n What city is this?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Puerto Pacifico,\\\" she told\\n him. \\\"Isn't that a lovely name?\\n It means peaceful port. In Spanish.\\\"\\n\\n\\n That was fine. At least he now\\n knew where he was. But as he\\n left the shop he began checking\\n off every west coast state, city,\\n town, and inlet. None, to the best\\n of his knowledge, was called\\n Puerto Pacifico.\\n\\n\\n He headed for the nearest\\n service station and asked for a\\n map. The attendant gave him one\\n which showed the city, but nothing\\n beyond.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Which way is it to San Francisco?\\\"\\n asked Pembroke.\\n\\n\\n \\\"That all depends on where\\n you are,\\\" the boy returned.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Okay, then where am I?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Pardon me, there's a customer,\\\"\\n the boy said. \\\"This is\\n Puerto Pacifico.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Pembroke watched him hurry\\n off to service a car with a sense\\n of having been given the runaround.\\n To his surprise, the boy\\n came back a few minutes later\\n after servicing the automobile.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Say, I've just figured out who\\n you are,\\\" the youngster told him.\\n \\\"I'd sure appreciate it if you'd\\n give me a little help on my lingo.\\n Also, you gas up the car first,\\n then try to sell 'em the oil\\u2014right?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Right,\\\" said Pembroke wearily.\\n \\\"What's wrong with your\\n lingo? Other than the fact that\\n it's not colloquial enough.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Not enough slang, huh? Well,\\n I guess I'll have to concentrate\\n on that. How about the smile?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Perfect,\\\" Pembroke told him.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yeah?\\\" said the boy delightedly.\\n \\\"Say, come back again,\\n huh? I sure appreciate the help.\\n Keep the map.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Thanks. One more thing,\\\"\\n Pembroke said. \\\"What's over\\n that way\\u2014outside the city?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Sand.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"How about that way?\\\" he\\n asked, pointing north. \\\"And that\\n way?\\\" pointing south.\\n\\n\\n \\\"More of the same.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Any railroads?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"That we ain't got.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Buses? Airlines?\\\"\\n\\n\\n The kid shook his head.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Some city.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yeah, it's kinda isolated. A\\n lot of ships dock here, though.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"All cargo ships, I'll bet. No\\n passengers,\\\" said Pembroke.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Right,\\\" said the attendant,\\n giving with his perfect smile.\\n\\n\\n \\\"No getting out of here, is\\n there?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's for sure,\\\" the boy said,\\n walking away to wait on another\\n customer. \\\"If you don't like the\\n place, you've had it.\\\"\\nPembroke returned to the\\n hotel. Going to the bar, he recognized\\n one of the\\nElena Mia's\\npaying\\n passengers. He was a short,\\n rectangular little man in his fifties\\n named Spencer. He sat in a\\n booth with three young women,\\n all lovely, all effusive. The topic\\n of the conversation turned out\\n to be precisely what Pembroke\\n had predicted.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, Louisa, I'd say your\\n only fault is the way you keep\\n wigglin' your shoulders up 'n'\\n down. Why'n'sha try holdin' 'em\\n straight?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I thought it made me look\\n sexy,\\\" the redhead said petulantly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Just be yourself, gal,\\\" Spencer\\n drawled, jabbing her intimately\\n with a fat elbow, \\\"and\\n you'll qualify.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Me, me,\\\" the blonde with a\\n feather cut was insisting. \\\"What\\n is wrong with me?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You're perfect, sweetheart,\\\"\\n he told her, taking her hand.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ah, come on,\\\" she pleaded.\\n \\\"Everyone tells me I chew gum\\n with my mouth open. Don't you\\n hate that?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Naw, that's part of your\\n charm,\\\" Spencer assured her.\\n\\n\\n \\\"How 'bout me, sugar,\\\" asked\\n the girl with the coal black hair.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ah, you're perfect, too. You\\n are all perfect. I've never seen\\n such a collection of dolls as parade\\n around this here city.\\n C'mon, kids\\u2014how 'bout another\\n round?\\\"\\n\\n\\n But the dolls had apparently\\n lost interest in him. They got up\\n one by one and walked out of the\\n bar. Pembroke took his rum and\\n tonic and moved over to Spencer's\\n booth.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Okay if I join you?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Sure,\\\" said the fat man.\\n \\\"Wonder what the hell got into\\n those babes?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You said they were perfect.\\n They know they're not. You've\\n got to be rough with them in this\\n town,\\\" said Pembroke. \\\"That's\\n all they want from us.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Mister, you've been doing\\n some thinkin', I can see,\\\" said\\n Spencer, peering at him suspiciously.\\n \\\"Maybe you've figured\\n out where we are.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Your bet's as good as mine,\\\"\\n said Pembroke. \\\"It's not Wellington,\\n and it's not Brisbane, and\\n it's not Long Beach, and it's not\\n Tahiti. There are a lot of places\\n it's not. But where the hell it is,\\n you tell me.\\n\\n\\n \\\"And, by the way,\\\" he added,\\n \\\"I hope you like it in Puerto\\n Pacifico. Because there isn't any\\n place to go from here and there\\n isn't any way to get there if\\n there were.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Pardon me, gentlemen, but\\n I'm Joe Valencia, manager of the\\n hotel. I would be very grateful if\\n you would give me a few minutes\\n of honest criticism.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ah, no, not you, too,\\\" groaned\\n Spencer. \\\"Look, Joe, what's\\n the gag?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You are newcomers, Mr.\\n Spencer,\\\" Valencia explained.\\n \\\"You are therefore in an excellent\\n position to point out our\\n faults as you see them.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, so what?\\\" demanded\\n Spencer. \\\"I've got more important\\n things to do than to worry\\n about your troubles. You look\\n okay to me.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Mr. Valencia,\\\" said Pembroke.\\n \\\"I've noticed that you\\n walk with a very slight limp. If\\n you have a bad leg, I should\\n think you would do better to develop\\n a more pronounced limp.\\n Otherwise, you may appear to\\n be self-conscious about it.\\\"\\nSpencer opened his mouth to\\n protest, but saw with amazement\\n that it was exactly this that\\n Valencia was seeking. Pembroke\\n was amused at his companion's\\n reaction but observed that Spencer\\n still failed to see the point.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Also, there is a certain effeminateness\\n in the way in which\\n you speak,\\\" said Pembroke. \\\"Try\\n to be a little more direct, a little\\n more brusque. Speak in a monotone.\\n It will make you more acceptable.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Thank you so much,\\\" said the\\n manager. \\\"There is much food\\n for thought in what you have\\n said, Mr. Pembroke. However,\\n Mr. Spencer, your value has failed\\n to prove itself. You have only\\n yourself to blame. Cooperation is\\n all we require of you.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Valencia left. Spencer ordered\\n another martini. Neither he nor\\n Pembroke spoke for several minutes.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Somebody's crazy around\\n here,\\\" the fat man muttered\\n after a few moments. \\\"Is it me,\\n Frank?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"No. You just don't belong\\n here, in this particular place,\\\"\\n said Pembroke thoughtfully.\\n \\\"You're the wrong type. But they\\n couldn't know that ahead of time.\\n The way they operate it's a\\n pretty hit-or-miss operation. But\\n they don't care one bit about us,\\n Spencer. Consider the men who\\n went down with the ship. That\\n was just part of the game.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"What the hell are you sayin'?\\\"\\n asked Spencer in disbelief.\\n \\\"You figure\\nthey\\nsunk the ship?\\n Valencia and the waitress and\\n the three babes? Ah, come on.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It's what you think that will\\n determine what you do, Spencer.\\n I suggest you change your attitude;\\n play along with them for a\\n few days till the picture becomes\\n a little clearer to you. We'll talk\\n about it again then.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Pembroke rose and started out\\n of the bar. A policeman entered\\n and walked directly to Spencer's\\n table. Loitering at the juke box,\\n Pembroke overheard the conversation.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You Spencer?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's right,\\\" said the fat\\n man sullenly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What don't you like about\\n me? The\\ntruth\\n, buddy.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ah, hell! Nothin' wrong\\n with you at all, and nothin'll\\n make me say there is,\\\" said Spencer.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You're the guy, all right. Too\\n bad, Mac,\\\" said the cop.\\n\\n\\n Pembroke heard the shots as\\n he strolled casually out into the\\n brightness of the hotel lobby.\\n While he waited for the elevator,\\n he saw them carrying the body\\n into the street. How many others,\\n he wondered, had gone out on\\n their backs during their first day\\n in Puerto Pacifico?\\nPembroke shaved, showered,\\n and put on the new suit and shirt\\n he had bought. Then he took\\n Mary Ann, the woman he had\\n met on the beach, out to dinner.\\n She would look magnificent even\\n when fully clothed, he decided,\\n and the pale chartreuse gown she\\n wore hardly placed her in that\\n category. Her conversation seemed\\n considerably more normal\\n after the other denizens of\\n Puerto Pacifico Pembroke had\\n listened to that afternoon.\\n\\n\\n After eating they danced for\\n an hour, had a few more drinks,\\n then went to Pembroke's room.\\n He still knew nothing about her\\n and had almost exhausted his\\n critical capabilities, but not once\\n had she become annoyed with\\n him. She seemed to devour every\\n factual point of imperfection\\n about herself that Pembroke\\n brought to her attention. And,\\n fantastically enough, she actually\\n appeared to have overcome every\\n little imperfection he had been\\n able to communicate to her.\\n\\n\\n It was in the privacy of his\\n room that Pembroke became\\n aware of just how perfect, physically,\\n Mary Ann was. Too perfect.\\n No freckles or moles anywhere\\n on the visible surface of\\n her brown skin, which was more\\n than a mere sampling. Furthermore,\\n her face and body were\\n meticulously symmetrical. And\\n she seemed to be wholly ambidextrous.\\n\\n\\n \\\"With so many beautiful\\n women in Puerto Pacifico,\\\" said\\n Pembroke probingly, \\\"I find it\\n hard to understand why there are\\n so few children.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes, children are decorative,\\n aren't they,\\\" said Mary Ann. \\\"I\\n do wish there were more of\\n them.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Why not have a couple of\\n your own?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, they're only given to maternal\\n types. I'd never get one.\\n Anyway, I won't ever marry,\\\"\\n she said. \\\"I'm the paramour\\n type.\\\"\\n\\n\\n It was obvious that the liquor\\n had been having some effect.\\n Either that, or she had a basic\\n flaw of loquacity that no one else\\n had discovered. Pembroke decided\\n he would have to cover his\\n tracks carefully.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What type am I?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Silly, you're real. You're not\\n a type at all.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Mary Ann, I love you very\\n much,\\\" Pembroke murmured,\\n gambling everything on this one\\n throw. \\\"When you go to Earth\\n I'll miss you terribly.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, but you'll be dead by\\n then,\\\" she pouted. \\\"So I mustn't\\n fall in love with you. I don't want\\n to be miserable.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"If I pretended I was one of\\n you, if I left on the boat with\\n you, they'd let me go to Earth\\n with you. Wouldn't they?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, yes, I'm sure they would.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Mary Ann, you have two\\n other flaws I feel I should mention.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes? Please tell me.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"In the first place,\\\" said Pembroke,\\n \\\"you should be willing to\\n fall in love with me even if it\\n will eventually make you unhappy.\\n How can you be the paramour\\n type if you refuse to fall in\\n love foolishly? And when you\\n have fallen in love, you should be\\n very loyal.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'll try,\\\" she said unsurely.\\n \\\"What else?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"The other thing is that, as\\n my mistress, you must never\\n mention me to anyone. It would\\n place me in great danger.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'll never tell anyone anything\\n about you,\\\" she promised.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Now try to love me,\\\" Pembroke\\n said, drawing her into his\\n arms and kissing with little\\n pleasure the smooth, warm perfection\\n of her tanned cheeks.\\n \\\"Love me my sweet, beautiful,\\n affectionate Mary Ann. My paramour.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Making love to Mary Ann was\\n something short of ecstasy. Not\\n for any obvious reason, but because\\n of subtle little factors that\\n make a woman a woman. Mary\\n Ann had no pulse. Mary Ann did\\n not perspire. Mary Ann did not\\n fatigue gradually but all at once.\\n Mary Ann breathed regularly\\n under all circumstances. Mary\\n Ann talked and talked and talked.\\n But then, Mary Ann was not\\n a human being.\\n\\n\\n When she left the hotel at midnight,\\n Pembroke was quite sure\\n that she understood his plan and\\n that she was irrevocably in love\\n with him. Tomorrow might bring\\n his death, but it might also ensure\\n his escape. After forty-two\\n years of searching for a passion,\\n for a cause, for a loyalty, Frank\\n Pembroke had at last found his.\\n Earth and the human race that\\n peopled it. And Mary Ann would\\n help him to save it.\\nThe next morning Pembroke\\n talked to Valencia about hunting.\\n He said that he planned to go\\n shooting out on the desert which\\n surrounded the city. Valencia\\n told him that there were no living\\n creatures anywhere but in\\n the city. Pembroke said he was\\n going out anyway.\\n\\n\\n He picked up Mary Ann at her\\n apartment and together they\\n went to a sporting goods store.\\n As he guessed there was a goodly\\n selection of firearms, despite the\\n fact that there was nothing to\\n hunt and only a single target\\n range within the city. Everything,\\n of course, had to be just\\n like Earth. That, after all, was\\n the purpose of Puerto Pacifico.\\n\\n\\n By noon they had rented a\\n jeep and were well away from\\n the city. Pembroke and Mary\\n Ann took turns firing at the paper\\n targets they had purchased. At\\n twilight they headed back to the\\n city. On the outskirts, where the\\n sand and soil were mixed and no\\n footprints would be left, Pembroke\\n hopped off. Mary Ann\\n would go straight to the police\\n and report that Pembroke had attacked\\n her and that she had shot\\n him. If necessary, she would conduct\\n the authorities to the place\\n where they had been target\\n shooting, but would be unable to\\n locate the spot where she had\\n buried the body. Why had she\\n buried it? Because at first she\\n was not going to report the incident.\\n She was frightened. It\\n was not airtight, but there would\\n probably be no further investigation.\\n And they certainly would\\n not prosecute Mary Ann for killing\\n an Earthman.\\n\\n\\n Now Pembroke had himself to\\n worry about. The first step was\\n to enter smoothly into the new\\n life he had planned. It wouldn't\\n be so comfortable as the previous\\n one, but should be considerably\\n safer. He headed slowly for the\\n \\\"old\\\" part of town, aging his\\n clothes against buildings and\\n fences as he walked. He had already\\n torn the collar of the shirt\\n and discarded his belt. By morning\\n his beard would grow to\\n blacken his face. And he would\\n look weary and hungry and aimless.\\n Only the last would be a deception.\\nTwo weeks later Pembroke\\n phoned Mary Ann. The police\\n had accepted her story without\\n even checking. And when, when\\n would she be seeing him again?\\n He had aroused her passion and\\n no amount of long-distance love\\n could requite it. Soon, he assured\\n her, soon.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Because, after all, you do owe\\n me something,\\\" she added.\\n\\n\\n And that was bad because it\\n sounded as if she had been giving\\n some womanly thought to the situation.\\n A little more of that and\\n she might go to the police again,\\n this time for vengeance.\\n\\n\\n Twice during his wanderings\\n Pembroke had seen the corpses\\n of Earthmen being carted out of\\n buildings. They had to be Earthmen\\n because they bled. Mary Ann\\n had admitted that she did not.\\n There would be very few Earthmen\\n left in Puerto Pacifico, and\\n it would be simple enough to locate\\n him if he were reported as\\n being on the loose. There was\\n no out but to do away with Mary\\n Ann.\\n\\n\\n Pembroke headed for the\\n beach. He knew she invariably\\n went there in the afternoon. He\\n loitered around the stalls where\\n hot dogs and soft drinks were\\n sold, leaning against a post in\\n the hot sun, hat pulled down over\\n his forehead. Then he noticed\\n that people all about him were\\n talking excitedly. They were discussing\\n a ship. It was leaving\\n that afternoon. Anyone who\\n could pass the interview would\\n be sent to Earth.\\n\\n\\n Pembroke had visited the\\n docks every day, without being\\n able to learn when the great\\n exodus would take place. Yet he\\n was certain the first lap would be\\n by water rather than by spaceship,\\n since no one he had talked\\n to in the city had ever heard of\\n spaceships. In fact, they knew\\n very little about their masters.\\n\\n\\n Now the ship had arrived and\\n was to leave shortly. If there was\\n any but the most superficial examination,\\n Pembroke would no\\n doubt be discovered and exterminated.\\n But since no one seemed\\n concerned about anything but his\\n own speech and behavior, he assumed\\n that they had all qualified\\n in every other respect. The reason\\n for transporting Earth People\\n to this planet was, of course,\\n to apply a corrective to any of\\n the Pacificos' aberrant mannerisms\\n or articulation. This was\\n the polishing up phase.\\nPembroke began hobbling toward\\n the docks. Almost at once\\n he found himself face to face\\n with Mary Ann. She smiled happily\\n when she recognized him.\\nThat\\nwas a good thing.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It is a sign of poor breeding\\n to smile at tramps,\\\" Pembroke\\n admonished her in a whisper.\\n \\\"Walk on ahead.\\\"\\n\\n\\n She obeyed. He followed. The\\n crowd grew thicker. They neared\\n the docks and Pembroke saw that\\n there were now set up on the\\n roped-off wharves small interviewing\\n booths. When it was\\n their turn, he and Mary Ann\\n each went into separate ones.\\n Pembroke found himself alone in\\n the little room.\\n\\n\\n Then he saw that there was\\n another entity in his presence\\n confined beneath a glass dome. It\\n looked rather like a groundhog\\n and had seven fingers on each of\\n its six limbs. But it was larger\\n and hairier than the glass one\\n he had seen at the gift store.\\n With four of its limbs it tapped\\n on an intricate keyboard in front\\n of it.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What is your name?\\\" queried\\n a metallic voice from a speaker\\n on the wall.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'm Jerry Newton. Got no\\n middle initial,\\\" Pembroke said in\\n a surly voice.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Occupation?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I work a lot o' trades. Fisherman,\\n fruit picker, fightin' range\\n fires, vineyards, car washer. Anything.\\n You name it. Been out of\\n work for a long time now,\\n though. Goin' on five months.\\n These here are hard times, no\\n matter what they say.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"What do you think of the\\n Chinese situation?\\\" the voice inquired.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Which situation's 'at?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Where's Seattle?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Seattle? State o' Washington.\\\"\\n\\n\\n And so it went for about five\\n minutes. Then he was told he\\n had qualified as a satisfactory\\n surrogate for a mid-twentieth\\n century American male, itinerant\\n type.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You understand your mission,\\n Newton?\\\" the voice asked. \\\"You\\n are to establish yourself on\\n Earth.

Happy\\n about it? Lucky you!\\nFrank Pembroke\\n sat behind\\n the desk of his shabby\\n little office over Lemark's Liquors\\n in downtown Los Angeles and\\n waited for his first customer. He\\n had been in business for a week\\n and as yet had had no callers.\\n Therefore, it was with a mingled\\n sense of excitement and satisfaction\\n that he greeted the tall,\\n dark, smooth-faced figure that\\n came up the stairs and into the\\n office shortly before noon.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Good day, sir,\\\" said Pembroke\\n with an amiable smile. \\\"I\\n see my advertisement has interested\\n you. Please stand in that\\n corner for just a moment.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Opening the desk drawer,\\n which was almost empty, Pembroke\\n removed an automatic pistol\\n fitted with a silencer. Pointing\\n it at the amazed customer, he\\n fired four .22 caliber longs into\\n the narrow chest. Then he made\\n a telephone call and sat down to\\n wait. He wondered how long it\\n would be before his next client\\n would arrive.\\nThe series of events leading up\\n to Pembroke's present occupation\\n had commenced on a dismal,\\n overcast evening in the South\\n Pacific a year earlier. Bound for\\n Sydney, two days out of Valparaiso,\\n the Colombian tramp\\n steamer\\nElena Mia\\nhad encountered\\n a dense greenish fog which\\n seemed vaguely redolent of citrus\\n trees. Standing on the forward\\n deck, Pembroke was one of the\\n first to perceive the peculiar odor\\n and to spot the immense gray\\n hulk wallowing in the murky distance.\\n\\n\\n Then the explosion had come,\\n from far below the waterline,\\n and the decks were awash with\\n frantic crewmen, officers, and the\\n handful of passengers. Only two\\n lifeboats were launched before\\n the\\nElena Mia\\nwent down. Pembroke\\n was in the second. The\\n roar of the sinking ship was the\\n last thing he heard for some\\n time.\\n\\n\\n Pembroke came as close to being\\n a professional adventurer as\\n one can in these days of regimented\\n travel, organized peril,\\n and political restriction. He had\\n made for himself a substantial\\n fortune through speculation in a\\n great variety of properties, real\\n and otherwise. Life had given\\n him much and demanded little,\\n which was perhaps the reason\\n for his restiveness.\\nLoyalty to person or to people\\n was a trait Pembroke had never\\n recognized in himself, nor had it\\n ever been expected of him. And\\n yet he greatly envied those\\n staunch patriots and lovers who\\n could find it in themselves to\\n elevate the glory and safety of\\n others above that of themselves.\\n\\n\\n Lacking such loyalties, Pembroke\\n adapted quickly to the situation\\n in which he found himself\\n when he regained consciousness.\\n He awoke in a small room in\\n what appeared to be a typical\\n modern American hotel. The wallet\\n in his pocket contained exactly\\n what it should, approximately\\n three hundred dollars.\\n His next thought was of food.\\n He left the room and descended\\n via the elevator to the restaurant.\\n Here he observed that it\\n was early afternoon. Ordering\\n a full dinner, for he was unusually\\n hungry, he began to study the\\n others in the restaurant.\\n\\n\\n Many of the faces seemed familiar;\\n the crew of the ship,\\n probably. He also recognized several\\n of the passengers. However,\\n he made no attempt to speak to\\n them. After his meal, he bought\\n a good corona and went for a\\n walk. His situation could have\\n been any small western American\\n seacoast city. He heard the hiss\\n of the ocean in the direction the\\n afternoon sun was taking. In his\\n full-gaited walk, he was soon approaching\\n the beach.\\n\\n\\n On the sand he saw a number\\n of sun bathers. One in particular,\\n an attractive woman of about\\n thirty, tossed back her long,\\n chestnut locks and gazed up intently\\n at Pembroke as he passed.\\n Seldom had he enjoyed so ingenuous\\n an invitation. He halted\\n and stared down at her for a few\\n moments.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You are looking for someone?\\\"\\n she inquired.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Much of the time,\\\" said the\\n man.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Could it be me?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It could be.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yet you seem unsure,\\\" she\\n said.\\n\\n\\n Pembroke smiled, uneasily.\\n There was something not entirely\\n normal about her conversation.\\n Though the rest of her compensated\\n for that.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Tell me what's wrong with\\n me,\\\" she went on urgently. \\\"I'm\\n not good enough, am I? I mean,\\n there's something wrong with\\n the way I look or act. Isn't there?\\n Please help me, please!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You're not casual enough, for\\n one thing,\\\" said Pembroke, deciding\\n to play along with her for\\n the moment. \\\"You're too tense.\\n Also you're a bit knock-kneed,\\n not that it matters. Is that what\\n you wanted to hear?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes, yes\\u2014I mean, I suppose\\n so. I can try to be more casual.\\n But I don't know what to do\\n about my knees,\\\" she said wistfully,\\n staring across at the\\n smooth, tan limbs. \\\"Do you think\\n I'm okay otherwise? I mean, as a\\n whole I'm not so bad, am I? Oh,\\n please tell me.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"How about talking it over at\\n supper tonight?\\\" Pembroke proposed.\\n \\\"Maybe with less distraction\\n I'll have a better picture of\\n you\\u2014as a whole.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, that's very generous of\\n you,\\\" the woman told him. She\\n scribbled a name and an address\\n on a small piece of paper and\\n handed it to him. \\\"Any time\\n after six,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\n Pembroke left the beach and\\n walked through several small\\n specialty shops. He tried to get\\n the woman off his mind, but the\\n oddness of her conversation continued\\n to bother him. She was\\n right about being different, but\\n it was her concern about being\\n different that made her so. How\\n to explain\\nthat\\nto her?\\nThen he saw the weird little\\n glass statuette among the usual\\n bric-a-brac. It rather resembled\\n a ground hog, had seven fingers\\n on each of its six limbs, and\\n smiled up at him as he stared.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Can I help you, sir?\\\" a middle-aged\\n saleswoman inquired.\\n \\\"Oh, good heavens, whatever is\\n that thing doing here?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Pembroke watched with lifted\\n eyebrows as the clerk whisked\\n the bizarre statuette underneath\\n the counter.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What the hell was that?\\\"\\n Pembroke demanded.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, you know\\u2014or don't you?\\n Oh, my,\\\" she concluded, \\\"are you\\n one of the\\u2014strangers?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"And if I were?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, I'd certainly appreciate\\n it if you'd tell me how I walk.\\\"\\nShe came around in front of\\n the counter and strutted back\\n and forth a few times.\\n\\n\\n \\\"They tell me I lean too far\\n forward,\\\" she confided. \\\"But I\\n should think you'd fall down if\\n you didn't.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Don't try to go so fast and\\n you won't fall down,\\\" suggested\\n Pembroke. \\\"You're in too much\\n of a hurry. Also those fake flowers\\n on your blouse make you look\\n frumpy.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, I'm supposed to look\\n frumpy,\\\" the woman retorted.\\n \\\"That's the type of person I am.\\n But you can look frumpy and still\\n walk natural, can't you? Everyone\\n says you can.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, they've got a point,\\\"\\n said Pembroke. \\\"Incidentally,\\n just where are we, anyway?\\n What city is this?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Puerto Pacifico,\\\" she told\\n him. \\\"Isn't that a lovely name?\\n It means peaceful port. In Spanish.\\\"\\n\\n\\n That was fine. At least he now\\n knew where he was. But as he\\n left the shop he began checking\\n off every west coast state, city,\\n town, and inlet. None, to the best\\n of his knowledge, was called\\n Puerto Pacifico.\\n\\n\\n He headed for the nearest\\n service station and asked for a\\n map. The attendant gave him one\\n which showed the city, but nothing\\n beyond.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Which way is it to San Francisco?\\\"\\n asked Pembroke.\\n\\n\\n \\\"That all depends on where\\n you are,\\\" the boy returned.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Okay, then where am I?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Pardon me, there's a customer,\\\"\\n the boy said. \\\"This is\\n Puerto Pacifico.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Pembroke watched him hurry\\n off to service a car with a sense\\n of having been given the runaround.\\n To his surprise, the boy\\n came back a few minutes later\\n after servicing the automobile.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Say, I've just figured out who\\n you are,\\\" the youngster told him.\\n \\\"I'd sure appreciate it if you'd\\n give me a little help on my lingo.\\n Also, you gas up the car first,\\n then try to sell 'em the oil\\u2014right?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Right,\\\" said Pembroke wearily.\\n \\\"What's wrong with your\\n lingo? Other than the fact that\\n it's not colloquial enough.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Not enough slang, huh? Well,\\n I guess I'll have to concentrate\\n on that. How about the smile?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Perfect,\\\" Pembroke told him.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yeah?\\\" said the boy delightedly.\\n \\\"Say, come back again,\\n huh? I sure appreciate the help.\\n Keep the map.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Thanks. One more thing,\\\"\\n Pembroke said. \\\"What's over\\n that way\\u2014outside the city?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Sand.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"How about that way?\\\" he\\n asked, pointing north. \\\"And that\\n way?\\\" pointing south.\\n\\n\\n \\\"More of the same.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Any railroads?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"That we ain't got.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Buses? Airlines?\\\"\\n\\n\\n The kid shook his head.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Some city.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yeah, it's kinda isolated. A\\n lot of ships dock here, though.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"All cargo ships, I'll bet. No\\n passengers,\\\" said Pembroke.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Right,\\\" said the attendant,\\n giving with his perfect smile.\\n\\n\\n \\\"No getting out of here, is\\n there?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's for sure,\\\" the boy said,\\n walking away to wait on another\\n customer. \\\"If you don't like the\\n place, you've had it.\\\"\\nPembroke returned to the\\n hotel. Going to the bar, he recognized\\n one of the\\nElena Mia's\\npaying\\n passengers. He was a short,\\n rectangular little man in his fifties\\n named Spencer. He sat in a\\n booth with three young women,\\n all lovely, all effusive. The topic\\n of the conversation turned out\\n to be precisely what Pembroke\\n had predicted.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, Louisa, I'd say your\\n only fault is the way you keep\\n wigglin' your shoulders up 'n'\\n down. Why'n'sha try holdin' 'em\\n straight?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I thought it made me look\\n sexy,\\\" the redhead said petulantly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Just be yourself, gal,\\\" Spencer\\n drawled, jabbing her intimately\\n with a fat elbow, \\\"and\\n you'll qualify.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Me, me,\\\" the blonde with a\\n feather cut was insisting. \\\"What\\n is wrong with me?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You're perfect, sweetheart,\\\"\\n he told her, taking her hand.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ah, come on,\\\" she pleaded.\\n \\\"Everyone tells me I chew gum\\n with my mouth open. Don't you\\n hate that?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Naw, that's part of your\\n charm,\\\" Spencer assured her.\\n\\n\\n \\\"How 'bout me, sugar,\\\" asked\\n the girl with the coal black hair.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ah, you're perfect, too. You\\n are all perfect. I've never seen\\n such a collection of dolls as parade\\n around this here city.\\n C'mon, kids\\u2014how 'bout another\\n round?\\\"\\n\\n\\n But the dolls had apparently\\n lost interest in him. They got up\\n one by one and walked out of the\\n bar. Pembroke took his rum and\\n tonic and moved over to Spencer's\\n booth.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Okay if I join you?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Sure,\\\" said the fat man.\\n \\\"Wonder what the hell got into\\n those babes?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You said they were perfect.\\n They know they're not. You've\\n got to be rough with them in this\\n town,\\\" said Pembroke. \\\"That's\\n all they want from us.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Mister, you've been doing\\n some thinkin', I can see,\\\" said\\n Spencer, peering at him suspiciously.\\n \\\"Maybe you've figured\\n out where we are.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Your bet's as good as mine,\\\"\\n said Pembroke. \\\"It's not Wellington,\\n and it's not Brisbane, and\\n it's not Long Beach, and it's not\\n Tahiti. There are a lot of places\\n it's not. But where the hell it is,\\n you tell me.\\n\\n\\n \\\"And, by the way,\\\" he added,\\n \\\"I hope you like it in Puerto\\n Pacifico. Because there isn't any\\n place to go from here and there\\n isn't any way to get there if\\n there were.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Pardon me, gentlemen, but\\n I'm Joe Valencia, manager of the\\n hotel. I would be very grateful if\\n you would give me a few minutes\\n of honest criticism.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ah, no, not you, too,\\\" groaned\\n Spencer. \\\"Look, Joe, what's\\n the gag?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You are newcomers, Mr.\\n Spencer,\\\" Valencia explained.\\n \\\"You are therefore in an excellent\\n position to point out our\\n faults as you see them.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, so what?\\\" demanded\\n Spencer. \\\"I've got more important\\n things to do than to worry\\n about your troubles. You look\\n okay to me.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Mr. Valencia,\\\" said Pembroke.\\n \\\"I've noticed that you\\n walk with a very slight limp. If\\n you have a bad leg, I should\\n think you would do better to develop\\n a more pronounced limp.\\n Otherwise, you may appear to\\n be self-conscious about it.\\\"\\nSpencer opened his mouth to\\n protest, but saw with amazement\\n that it was exactly this that\\n Valencia was seeking. Pembroke\\n was amused at his companion's\\n reaction but observed that Spencer\\n still failed to see the point.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Also, there is a certain effeminateness\\n in the way in which\\n you speak,\\\" said Pembroke. \\\"Try\\n to be a little more direct, a little\\n more brusque. Speak in a monotone.\\n It will make you more acceptable.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Thank you so much,\\\" said the\\n manager. \\\"There is much food\\n for thought in what you have\\n said, Mr. Pembroke. However,\\n Mr. Spencer, your value has failed\\n to prove itself. You have only\\n yourself to blame. Cooperation is\\n all we require of you.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Valencia left. Spencer ordered\\n another martini. Neither he nor\\n Pembroke spoke for several minutes.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Somebody's crazy around\\n here,\\\" the fat man muttered\\n after a few moments. \\\"Is it me,\\n Frank?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"No. You just don't belong\\n here, in this particular place,\\\"\\n said Pembroke thoughtfully.\\n \\\"You're the wrong type. But they\\n couldn't know that ahead of time.\\n The way they operate it's a\\n pretty hit-or-miss operation. But\\n they don't care one bit about us,\\n Spencer. Consider the men who\\n went down with the ship. That\\n was just part of the game.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"What the hell are you sayin'?\\\"\\n asked Spencer in disbelief.\\n \\\"You figure\\nthey\\nsunk the ship?\\n Valencia and the waitress and\\n the three babes? Ah, come on.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It's what you think that will\\n determine what you do, Spencer.\\n I suggest you change your attitude;\\n play along with them for a\\n few days till the picture becomes\\n a little clearer to you. We'll talk\\n about it again then.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Pembroke rose and started out\\n of the bar. A policeman entered\\n and walked directly to Spencer's\\n table. Loitering at the juke box,\\n Pembroke overheard the conversation.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You Spencer?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's right,\\\" said the fat\\n man sullenly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What don't you like about\\n me? The\\ntruth\\n, buddy.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ah, hell! Nothin' wrong\\n with you at all, and nothin'll\\n make me say there is,\\\" said Spencer.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You're the guy, all right. Too\\n bad, Mac,\\\" said the cop.\\n\\n\\n Pembroke heard the shots as\\n he strolled casually out into the\\n brightness of the hotel lobby.\\n While he waited for the elevator,\\n he saw them carrying the body\\n into the street. How many others,\\n he wondered, had gone out on\\n their backs during their first day\\n in Puerto Pacifico?\\nPembroke shaved, showered,\\n and put on the new suit and shirt\\n he had bought. Then he took\\n Mary Ann, the woman he had\\n met on the beach, out to dinner.\\n She would look magnificent even\\n when fully clothed, he decided,\\n and the pale chartreuse gown she\\n wore hardly placed her in that\\n category. Her conversation seemed\\n considerably more normal\\n after the other denizens of\\n Puerto Pacifico Pembroke had\\n listened to that afternoon.\\n\\n\\n After eating they danced for\\n an hour, had a few more drinks,\\n then went to Pembroke's room.\\n He still knew nothing about her\\n and had almost exhausted his\\n critical capabilities, but not once\\n had she become annoyed with\\n him. She seemed to devour every\\n factual point of imperfection\\n about herself that Pembroke\\n brought to her attention. And,\\n fantastically enough, she actually\\n appeared to have overcome every\\n little imperfection he had been\\n able to communicate to her.\\n\\n\\n It was in the privacy of his\\n room that Pembroke became\\n aware of just how perfect, physically,\\n Mary Ann was. Too perfect.\\n No freckles or moles anywhere\\n on the visible surface of\\n her brown skin, which was more\\n than a mere sampling. Furthermore,\\n her face and body were\\n meticulously symmetrical. And\\n she seemed to be wholly ambidextrous.\\n\\n\\n \\\"With so many beautiful\\n women in Puerto Pacifico,\\\" said\\n Pembroke probingly, \\\"I find it\\n hard to understand why there are\\n so few children.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes, children are decorative,\\n aren't they,\\\" said Mary Ann. \\\"I\\n do wish there were more of\\n them.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Why not have a couple of\\n your own?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, they're only given to maternal\\n types. I'd never get one.\\n Anyway, I won't ever marry,\\\"\\n she said. \\\"I'm the paramour\\n type.\\\"\\n\\n\\n It was obvious that the liquor\\n had been having some effect.\\n Either that, or she had a basic\\n flaw of loquacity that no one else\\n had discovered. Pembroke decided\\n he would have to cover his\\n tracks carefully.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What type am I?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Silly, you're real. You're not\\n a type at all.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Mary Ann, I love you very\\n much,\\\" Pembroke murmured,\\n gambling everything on this one\\n throw. \\\"When you go to Earth\\n I'll miss you terribly.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, but you'll be dead by\\n then,\\\" she pouted. \\\"So I mustn't\\n fall in love with you. I don't want\\n to be miserable.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"If I pretended I was one of\\n you, if I left on the boat with\\n you, they'd let me go to Earth\\n with you. Wouldn't they?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, yes, I'm sure they would.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Mary Ann, you have two\\n other flaws I feel I should mention.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes? Please tell me.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"In the first place,\\\" said Pembroke,\\n \\\"you should be willing to\\n fall in love with me even if it\\n will eventually make you unhappy.\\n How can you be the paramour\\n type if you refuse to fall in\\n love foolishly? And when you\\n have fallen in love, you should be\\n very loyal.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'll try,\\\" she said unsurely.\\n \\\"What else?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"The other thing is that, as\\n my mistress, you must never\\n mention me to anyone. It would\\n place me in great danger.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'll never tell anyone anything\\n about you,\\\" she promised.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Now try to love me,\\\" Pembroke\\n said, drawing her into his\\n arms and kissing with little\\n pleasure the smooth, warm perfection\\n of her tanned cheeks.\\n \\\"Love me my sweet, beautiful,\\n affectionate Mary Ann. My paramour.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Making love to Mary Ann was\\n something short of ecstasy. Not\\n for any obvious reason, but because\\n of subtle little factors that\\n make a woman a woman. Mary\\n Ann had no pulse. Mary Ann did\\n not perspire. Mary Ann did not\\n fatigue gradually but all at once.\\n Mary Ann breathed regularly\\n under all circumstances. Mary\\n Ann talked and talked and talked.\\n But then, Mary Ann was not\\n a human being.\\n\\n\\n When she left the hotel at midnight,\\n Pembroke was quite sure\\n that she understood his plan and\\n that she was irrevocably in love\\n with him. Tomorrow might bring\\n his death, but it might also ensure\\n his escape. After forty-two\\n years of searching for a passion,\\n for a cause, for a loyalty, Frank\\n Pembroke had at last found his.\\n Earth and the human race that\\n peopled it. And Mary Ann would\\n help him to save it.\\nThe next morning Pembroke\\n talked to Valencia about hunting.\\n He said that he planned to go\\n shooting out on the desert which\\n surrounded the city. Valencia\\n told him that there were no living\\n creatures anywhere but in\\n the city. Pembroke said he was\\n going out anyway.\\n\\n\\n He picked up Mary Ann at her\\n apartment and together they\\n went to a sporting goods store.\\n As he guessed there was a goodly\\n selection of firearms, despite the\\n fact that there was nothing to\\n hunt and only a single target\\n range within the city. Everything,\\n of course, had to be just\\n like Earth. That, after all, was\\n the purpose of Puerto Pacifico.\\n\\n\\n By noon they had rented a\\n jeep and were well away from\\n the city. Pembroke and Mary\\n Ann took turns firing at the paper\\n targets they had purchased. At\\n twilight they headed back to the\\n city. On the outskirts, where the\\n sand and soil were mixed and no\\n footprints would be left, Pembroke\\n hopped off. Mary Ann\\n would go straight to the police\\n and report that Pembroke had attacked\\n her and that she had shot\\n him. If necessary, she would conduct\\n the authorities to the place\\n where they had been target\\n shooting, but would be unable to\\n locate the spot where she had\\n buried the body. Why had she\\n buried it? Because at first she\\n was not going to report the incident.\\n She was frightened. It\\n was not airtight, but there would\\n probably be no further investigation.\\n And they certainly would\\n not prosecute Mary Ann for killing\\n an Earthman.\\n\\n\\n Now Pembroke had himself to\\n worry about. The first step was\\n to enter smoothly into the new\\n life he had planned. It wouldn't\\n be so comfortable as the previous\\n one, but should be considerably\\n safer. He headed slowly for the\\n \\\"old\\\" part of town, aging his\\n clothes against buildings and\\n fences as he walked. He had already\\n torn the collar of the shirt\\n and discarded his belt. By morning\\n his beard would grow to\\n blacken his face. And he would\\n look weary and hungry and aimless.\\n Only the last would be a deception.\\nTwo weeks later Pembroke\\n phoned Mary Ann. The police\\n had accepted her story without\\n even checking. And when, when\\n would she be seeing him again?\\n He had aroused her passion and\\n no amount of long-distance love\\n could requite it. Soon, he assured\\n her, soon.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Because, after all, you do owe\\n me something,\\\" she added.\\n\\n\\n And that was bad because it\\n sounded as if she had been giving\\n some womanly thought to the situation.\\n A little more of that and\\n she might go to the police again,\\n this time for vengeance.\\n\\n\\n Twice during his wanderings\\n Pembroke had seen the corpses\\n of Earthmen being carted out of\\n buildings. They had to be Earthmen\\n because they bled. Mary Ann\\n had admitted that she did not.\\n There would be very few Earthmen\\n left in Puerto Pacifico, and\\n it would be simple enough to locate\\n him if he were reported as\\n being on the loose. There was\\n no out but to do away with Mary\\n Ann.\\n\\n\\n Pembroke headed for the\\n beach. He knew she invariably\\n went there in the afternoon. He\\n loitered around the stalls where\\n hot dogs and soft drinks were\\n sold, leaning against a post in\\n the hot sun, hat pulled down over\\n his forehead. Then he noticed\\n that people all about him were\\n talking excitedly. They were discussing\\n a ship. It was leaving\\n that afternoon. Anyone who\\n could pass the interview would\\n be sent to Earth.\\n\\n\\n Pembroke had visited the\\n docks every day, without being\\n able to learn when the great\\n exodus would take place. Yet he\\n was certain the first lap would be\\n by water rather than by spaceship,\\n since no one he had talked\\n to in the city had ever heard of\\n spaceships. In fact, they knew\\n very little about their masters.\\n\\n\\n Now the ship had arrived and\\n was to leave shortly. If there was\\n any but the most superficial examination,\\n Pembroke would no\\n doubt be discovered and exterminated.\\n But since no one seemed\\n concerned about anything but his\\n own speech and behavior, he assumed\\n that they had all qualified\\n in every other respect. The reason\\n for transporting Earth People\\n to this planet was, of course,\\n to apply a corrective to any of\\n the Pacificos' aberrant mannerisms\\n or articulation. This was\\n the polishing up phase.\\nPembroke began hobbling toward\\n the docks. Almost at once\\n he found himself face to face\\n with Mary Ann. She smiled happily\\n when she recognized him.\\nThat\\nwas a good thing.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It is a sign of poor breeding\\n to smile at tramps,\\\" Pembroke\\n admonished her in a whisper.\\n \\\"Walk on ahead.\\\"\\n\\n\\n She obeyed. He followed. The\\n crowd grew thicker. They neared\\n the docks and Pembroke saw that\\n there were now set up on the\\n roped-off wharves small interviewing\\n booths. When it was\\n their turn, he and Mary Ann\\n each went into separate ones.\\n Pembroke found himself alone in\\n the little room.\\n\\n\\n Then he saw that there was\\n another entity in his presence\\n confined beneath a glass dome. It\\n looked rather like a groundhog\\n and had seven fingers on each of\\n its six limbs. But it was larger\\n and hairier than the glass one\\n he had seen at the gift store.\\n With four of its limbs it tapped\\n on an intricate keyboard in front\\n of it.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What is your name?\\\" queried\\n a metallic voice from a speaker\\n on the wall.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'm Jerry Newton. Got no\\n middle initial,\\\" Pembroke said in\\n a surly voice.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Occupation?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I work a lot o' trades. Fisherman,\\n fruit picker, fightin' range\\n fires, vineyards, car washer. Anything.\\n You name it. Been out of\\n work for a long time now,\\n though. Goin' on five months.\\n These here are hard times, no\\n matter what they say.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"What do you think of the\\n Chinese situation?\\\" the voice inquired.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Which situation's 'at?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Where's Seattle?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Seattle? State o' Washington.\\\"\\n\\n\\n And so it went for about five\\n minutes. Then he was told he\\n had qualified as a satisfactory\\n surrogate for a mid-twentieth\\n century American male, itinerant\\n type.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You understand your mission,\\n Newton?\\\" the voice asked. \\\"You\\n are to establish yourself on\\n Earth. In time you will receive\\n instructions. Then you will attack.\\n You will not see us, your\\n masters, again until the atmosphere\\n has been sufficiently chlorinated.\\n In the meantime, serve\\n us well.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He stumbled out toward the\\n docks, then looked about for\\n Mary Ann. He saw her at last\\n behind the ropes, her lovely face\\n in tears.\\n\\n\\n Then she saw him. Waving\\n frantically, she called his name\\n several times. Pembroke mingled\\n with the crowd moving toward\\n the ship, ignoring her. But still\\n the woman persisted in her\\n shouting.\\n\\n\\n Sidling up to a well-dressed\\n man-about-town type, Pembroke\\n winked at him and snickered.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You Frank?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Hell, no. But some poor\\n punk's sure red in the face, I'll\\n bet,\\\" the man-about-town said\\n with a chuckle. \\\"Those high-strung\\n paramour types always\\n raising a ruckus. They never do\\n pass the interview. Don't know\\n why they even make 'em.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Suddenly Mary Ann was quiet.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ambulance squad,\\\" Pembroke's\\n companion explained.\\n \\\"They'll take her off to the buggy\\n house for a few days and bring\\n her out fresh and ignorant as the\\n day she was assembled. Don't\\n know why they keep making 'em,\\n as I say. But I guess there's a\\n call for that type up there on\\n Earth.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yeah, I reckon there is at\\n that,\\\" said Pembroke, snickering\\n again as he moved away from the\\n other. \\\"And why not? Hey?\\n Why not?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Pembroke went right on hating\\n himself, however, till the\\n night he was deposited in a field\\n outside of Ensenada, broke but\\n happy, with two other itinerant\\n types. They separated in San\\n Diego, and it was not long before\\n Pembroke was explaining to the\\n police how he had drifted far\\n from the scene of the sinking of\\n the\\nElena Mia\\non a piece of\\n wreckage, and had been picked\\n up by a Chilean trawler. How he\\n had then made his way, with\\n much suffering, up the coast to\\n California. Two days later, his\\n identity established and his circumstances\\n again solvent, he was\\n headed for Los Angeles to begin\\n his save-Earth campaign.\\nNow, seated at his battered\\n desk in the shabby rented office\\n over Lemark's Liquors, Pembroke\\n gazed without emotion at\\n the two demolished Pacificos that\\n lay sprawled one atop the other\\n in the corner. His watch said\\n one-fifteen. The man from the\\n FBI should arrive soon.\\n\\n\\n There were footsteps on the\\n stairs for the third time that\\n day. Not the brisk, efficient steps\\n of a federal official, but the hesitant,\\n self-conscious steps of a\\n junior clerk type.\\n\\n\\n Pembroke rose as the young\\n man appeared at the door. His\\n face was smooth, unpimpled,\\n clean-shaven, without sweat on a\\n warm summer afternoon.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Are you Dr. Von Schubert?\\\"\\n the newcomer asked, peering into\\n the room. \\\"You see, I've got a\\n problem\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n The four shots from Pembroke's\\n pistol solved his problem\\n effectively. Pembroke tossed his\\n third victim onto the pile, then\\n opened a can of lager, quaffing\\n it appreciatively. Seating himself\\n once more, he leaned back in\\n the chair, both feet upon the\\n desk.\\n\\n\\n He would be out of business\\n soon, once the FBI agent had got\\n there. Pembroke was only in it to\\n get the proof he would need to\\n convince people of the truth of\\n his tale. But in the meantime he\\n allowed himself to admire the\\n clipping of the newspaper ad he\\n had run in all the Los Angeles\\n papers for the past week. The\\n little ad that had saved mankind\\n from God-knew-what insidious\\n menace. It read:\\nARE YOU IMPERFECT?\\nLET DR.
