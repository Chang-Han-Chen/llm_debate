He stayed on because\\n he wanted to find out what the\\n trick was that made the gadget work.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It's all explained right here in\\n your instruction book,\\\" the demonstrator\\n said, holding up a garishly\\n printed booklet opened to a four-color\\n diagram. \\\"You all know how\\n magnets pick up things and I bet\\n you even know that the earth itself is\\n one great big magnet\\u2014that's why\\n compasses always point north. Well\\n ... the Atomic Wonder Space\\n Wave Tapper hangs onto those space\\n waves. Invisibly all about us, and\\n even going right through us, are the\\n magnetic waves of the earth. The\\n Atomic Wonder rides these waves\\n just the way a ship rides the waves\\n in the ocean. Now watch....\\\"\\n\\n\\n Every eye was on him as he put the\\n gaudy model rocketship on top of the\\n table and stepped back. It was made\\n of stamped metal and seemed as incapable\\n of flying as a can of ham\\u2014which\\n it very much resembled. Neither\\n wings, propellors, nor jets broke\\n through the painted surface. It rested\\n on three rubber wheels and coming\\n out through the bottom was a double\\n strand of thin insulated wire. This\\n white wire ran across the top of the\\n black table and terminated in a control\\n box in the demonstrator's hand.\\n An indicator light, a switch and a\\n knob appeared to be the only controls.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I turn on the Power Switch, sending\\n a surge of current to the Wave\\n Receptors,\\\" he said. The switch\\n clicked and the light blinked on and\\n off with a steady pulse. Then the\\n man began to slowly turn the knob.\\n \\\"A careful touch on the Wave Generator\\n is necessary as we are dealing\\n with the powers of the whole world\\n here....\\\"\\n\\n\\n A concerted\\nahhhh\\nswept through\\n the crowd as the Space Wave Tapper\\n shivered a bit, then rose slowly into\\n the air. The demonstrator stepped\\n back and the toy rose higher and\\n higher, bobbing gently on the invisible\\n waves of magnetic force that\\n supported it. Ever so slowly the power\\n was reduced and it settled back to\\n the table.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Only $17.95,\\\" the young man\\n said, putting a large price sign on the\\n table. \\\"For the complete set of the\\n Atomic Wonder, the Space Tapper\\n control box, battery and instruction\\n book ...\\\"\\n\\n\\n At the appearance of the price\\n card the crowd broke up noisily and\\n the children rushed away towards the\\n operating model trains. The demonstrator's\\n words were lost in their\\n noisy passage, and after a moment he\\n sank into a gloomy silence. He put\\n the control box down, yawned and\\n sat on the edge of the table. Colonel\\n Hawton was the only one left after\\n the crowd had moved on.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Could you tell me how this thing\\n works?\\\" the colonel asked, coming\\n forward. The demonstrator brightened\\n up and picked up one of the\\n toys.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, if you will look here,\\n sir....\\\" He opened the hinged top.\\n \\\"You will see the Space Wave coils\\n at each end of the ship.\\\" With a pencil\\n he pointed out the odd shaped\\n plastic forms about an inch in diameter\\n that had been wound\\u2014apparently\\n at random\\u2014with a few turns of\\n copper wire. Except for these coils\\n the interior of the model was empty.\\n The coils were wired together and\\n other wires ran out through the hole\\n in the bottom of the control box.\\n Biff Hawton turned a very quizzical\\n eye on the gadget and upon the demonstrator\\n who completely ignored this\\n sign of disbelief.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Inside the control box is the battery,\\\"\\n the young man said, snapping\\n it open and pointing to an ordinary\\n flashlight battery. \\\"The current goes\\n through the Power Switch and Power\\n Light to the Wave Generator ...\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"What you mean to say,\\\" Biff\\n broke in, \\\"is that the juice from this\\n fifteen cent battery goes through this\\n cheap rheostat to those meaningless\\n coils in the model and absolutely\\n nothing happens. Now tell me what\\n really flies the thing. If I'm going to\\n drop eighteen bucks for six-bits\\n worth of tin, I want to know what\\n I'm getting.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The demonstrator flushed. \\\"I'm\\n sorry, sir,\\\" he stammered. \\\"I wasn't\\n trying to hide anything. Like any\\n magic trick this one can't be really\\n demonstrated until it has been purchased.\\\"\\n He leaned forward and whispered\\n confidentially. \\\"I'll tell you\\n what I'll do though. This thing is way\\n overpriced and hasn't been moving at\\n all. The manager said I could let them\\n go at three dollars if I could find any\\n takers. If you want to buy it for that\\n price....\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Sold, my boy!\\\" the colonel said,\\n slamming three bills down on the\\n table. \\\"I'll give that much for it no\\n matter\\nhow\\nit works. The boys in the\\n shop will get a kick out of it,\\\" he\\n tapped the winged rocket on his\\n chest. \\\"Now\\nreally\\n\\u2014what holds it\\n up?\\\"\\n\\n\\n The demonstrator looked around\\n carefully, then pointed. \\\"Strings!\\\" he\\n said. \\\"Or rather a black thread. It\\n runs from the top of the model,\\n through a tiny loop in the ceiling,\\n and back down to my hand\\u2014tied to\\n this ring on my finger. When I back\\n up\\u2014the model rises. It's as simple as\\n that.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"All good illusions are simple,\\\"\\n the colonel grunted, tracing the black\\n thread with his eye. \\\"As long as\\n there is plenty of flimflam to distract\\n the viewer.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"If you don't have a black table, a\\n black cloth will do,\\\" the young man\\n said. \\\"And the arch of a doorway is a\\n good site, just see that the room in\\n back is dark.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Wrap it up, my boy, I wasn't born\\n yesterday. I'm an old hand at this\\n kind of thing.\\\"\\nBiff Hawton sprang it at the next\\n Thursday-night poker party. The\\n gang were all missile men and they\\n cheered and jeered as he hammed\\n up the introduction.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Let me copy the diagram, Biff, I\\n could use some of those magnetic\\n waves in the new bird!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Those flashlight batteries are\\n cheaper than lox, this is the thing of\\n the future!\\\"\\n\\n\\n Only Teddy Kaner caught wise as\\n the flight began. He was an amateur\\n magician and spotted the gimmick at\\n once. He kept silent with professional\\n courtesy, and smiled ironically as\\n the rest of the bunch grew silent one\\n by one. The colonel was a good showman\\n and he had set the scene well.\\n He almost had them believing in the\\n Space Wave Tapper before he was\\n through. When the model had landed\\n and he had switched it off he couldn't\\n stop them from crowding around\\n the table.\\n\\n\\n \\\"A thread!\\\" one of the engineers\\n shouted, almost with relief, and they\\n all laughed along with him.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Too bad,\\\" the head project physicist\\n said, \\\"I was hoping that a little\\n Space Wave Tapping could help us\\n out. Let me try a flight with it.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Teddy Kaner first,\\\" Biff announced.\\n \\\"He spotted it while you\\n were all watching the flashing lights,\\n only he didn't say anything.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Kaner slipped the ring with the\\n black thread over his finger and started\\n to step back.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You have to turn the switch on\\n first,\\\" Biff said.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I know,\\\" Kaner smiled. \\\"But\\n that's part of illusion\\u2014the spiel and\\n the misdirection. I'm going to try\\n this cold first, so I can get it moving\\n up and down smoothly, then go\\n through it with the whole works.\\\"\\n\\nILLUSTRATED BY BREY\\n\\n He moved his hand back smoothly,\\n in a professional manner that drew\\n no attention to it. The model lifted\\n from the table\\u2014then crashed back\\n down.\\n\\n\\n \\\"The thread broke,\\\" Kaner said.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You jerked it, instead of pulling\\n smoothly,\\\" Biff said and knotted the\\n broken thread. \\\"Here let me show\\n you how to do it.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The thread broke again when Biff\\n tried it, which got a good laugh that\\n made his collar a little warm. Someone\\n mentioned the poker game.\\n\\n\\n This was the only time that poker\\n was mentioned or even remembered\\n that night. Because very soon after\\n this they found that the thread would\\n lift the model only when the switch\\n was on and two and a half volts\\n flowing through the joke coils. With\\n the current turned off the model was\\n too heavy to lift. The thread broke\\n every time.\\n\\\"I still think it's a screwy idea,\\\"\\n the young man said. \\\"One week getting\\n fallen arches, demonstrating\\n those toy ships for every brat within\\n a thousand miles. Then selling the\\n things for three bucks when they\\n must have cost at least a hundred dollars\\n apiece to make.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"But you\\ndid\\nsell the ten of them\\n to people who would be interested?\\\"\\n the older man asked.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I think so, I caught a few Air\\n Force officers and a colonel in missiles\\n one day. Then there was one official\\n I remembered from the Bureau\\n of Standards. Luckily he didn't recognize\\n me. Then those two professors\\n you spotted from the university.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Then the problem is out of our\\n hands and into theirs. All we have to\\n do now is sit back and wait for results.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nWhat\\nresults?! These people\\n weren't interested when we were\\n hammering on their doors with the\\n proof. We've patented the coils and\\n can prove to anyone that there is a\\n reduction in weight around them\\n when they are operating....\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"But a small reduction. And we\\n don't know what is causing it. No\\n one can be interested in a thing like\\n that\\u2014a fractional weight decrease in\\n a clumsy model, certainly not enough\\n to lift the weight of the generator.\\n No one wrapped up in massive fuel\\n consumption, tons of lift and such is\\n going to have time to worry about a\\n crackpot who thinks he has found a\\n minor slip in Newton's laws.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You think they will now?\\\" the\\n young man asked, cracking his knuckles\\n impatiently.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I\\nknow\\nthey will. The tensile\\n strength of that thread is correctly adjusted\\n to the weight of the model.\\n The thread will break if you try to\\n lift the model with it. Yet you can\\n lift the model\\u2014after a small increment\\n of its weight has been removed\\n by the coils. This is going to bug\\n these men. Nobody is going to ask\\n them to solve the problem or concern\\n themselves with it. But it will\\n nag at them because they know this\\n effect can't possibly exist. They'll see\\n at once that the magnetic-wave theory\\n is nonsense. Or perhaps true? We\\n don't know. But they will all be\\n thinking about it and worrying about\\n it. Someone is going to experiment\\n in his basement\\u2014just as a hobby of\\n course\\u2014to find the cause of the error.\\n And he or someone else is going\\n to find out what makes those coils\\n work, or maybe a way to improve\\n them!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"And we have the patents....\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Correct. They will be doing the\\n research that will take them out of\\n the massive-lift-propulsion business\\n and into the field of pure space\\n flight.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"And in doing so they will be making\\n us rich\\u2014whenever the time\\n comes to manufacture,\\\" the young\\n man said cynically.\\n\\n\\n \\\"We'll all be rich, son,\\\" the older\\n man said, patting him on the shoulder.\\n \\\"Believe me, you're not going to\\n recognize this old world ten years\\n from now.\\\"\\nTranscriber's Note:\\nThis etext was produced from\\nAnalog\\nApril 1962.\\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\\n copyright on this publication was renewed.

He stayed on because\\n he wanted to find out what the\\n trick was that made the gadget work.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It's all explained right here in\\n your instruction book,\\\" the demonstrator\\n said, holding up a garishly\\n printed booklet opened to a four-color\\n diagram. \\\"You all know how\\n magnets pick up things and I bet\\n you even know that the earth itself is\\n one great big magnet\\u2014that's why\\n compasses always point north. Well\\n ... the Atomic Wonder Space\\n Wave Tapper hangs onto those space\\n waves. Invisibly all about us, and\\n even going right through us, are the\\n magnetic waves of the earth. The\\n Atomic Wonder rides these waves\\n just the way a ship rides the waves\\n in the ocean. Now watch....\\\"\\n\\n\\n Every eye was on him as he put the\\n gaudy model rocketship on top of the\\n table and stepped back. It was made\\n of stamped metal and seemed as incapable\\n of flying as a can of ham\\u2014which\\n it very much resembled. Neither\\n wings, propellors, nor jets broke\\n through the painted surface. It rested\\n on three rubber wheels and coming\\n out through the bottom was a double\\n strand of thin insulated wire. This\\n white wire ran across the top of the\\n black table and terminated in a control\\n box in the demonstrator's hand.\\n An indicator light, a switch and a\\n knob appeared to be the only controls.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I turn on the Power Switch, sending\\n a surge of current to the Wave\\n Receptors,\\\" he said. The switch\\n clicked and the light blinked on and\\n off with a steady pulse. Then the\\n man began to slowly turn the knob.\\n \\\"A careful touch on the Wave Generator\\n is necessary as we are dealing\\n with the powers of the whole world\\n here....\\\"\\n\\n\\n A concerted\\nahhhh\\nswept through\\n the crowd as the Space Wave Tapper\\n shivered a bit, then rose slowly into\\n the air. The demonstrator stepped\\n back and the toy rose higher and\\n higher, bobbing gently on the invisible\\n waves of magnetic force that\\n supported it. Ever so slowly the power\\n was reduced and it settled back to\\n the table.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Only $17.95,\\\" the young man\\n said, putting a large price sign on the\\n table. \\\"For the complete set of the\\n Atomic Wonder, the Space Tapper\\n control box, battery and instruction\\n book ...\\\"\\n\\n\\n At the appearance of the price\\n card the crowd broke up noisily and\\n the children rushed away towards the\\n operating model trains. The demonstrator's\\n words were lost in their\\n noisy passage, and after a moment he\\n sank into a gloomy silence. He put\\n the control box down, yawned and\\n sat on the edge of the table. Colonel\\n Hawton was the only one left after\\n the crowd had moved on.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Could you tell me how this thing\\n works?\\\" the colonel asked, coming\\n forward. The demonstrator brightened\\n up and picked up one of the\\n toys.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, if you will look here,\\n sir....\\\" He opened the hinged top.\\n \\\"You will see the Space Wave coils\\n at each end of the ship.\\\" With a pencil\\n he pointed out the odd shaped\\n plastic forms about an inch in diameter\\n that had been wound\\u2014apparently\\n at random\\u2014with a few turns of\\n copper wire. Except for these coils\\n the interior of the model was empty.\\n The coils were wired together and\\n other wires ran out through the hole\\n in the bottom of the control box.\\n Biff Hawton turned a very quizzical\\n eye on the gadget and upon the demonstrator\\n who completely ignored this\\n sign of disbelief.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Inside the control box is the battery,\\\"\\n the young man said, snapping\\n it open and pointing to an ordinary\\n flashlight battery. \\\"The current goes\\n through the Power Switch and Power\\n Light to the Wave Generator ...\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"What you mean to say,\\\" Biff\\n broke in, \\\"is that the juice from this\\n fifteen cent battery goes through this\\n cheap rheostat to those meaningless\\n coils in the model and absolutely\\n nothing happens. Now tell me what\\n really flies the thing. If I'm going to\\n drop eighteen bucks for six-bits\\n worth of tin, I want to know what\\n I'm getting.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The demonstrator flushed. \\\"I'm\\n sorry, sir,\\\" he stammered. \\\"I wasn't\\n trying to hide anything. Like any\\n magic trick this one can't be really\\n demonstrated until it has been purchased.\\\"\\n He leaned forward and whispered\\n confidentially. \\\"I'll tell you\\n what I'll do though. This thing is way\\n overpriced and hasn't been moving at\\n all. The manager said I could let them\\n go at three dollars if I could find any\\n takers.

It\\n runs from the top of the model,\\n through a tiny loop in the ceiling,\\n and back down to my hand\\u2014tied to\\n this ring on my finger. When I back\\n up\\u2014the model rises. It's as simple as\\n that.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"All good illusions are simple,\\\"\\n the colonel grunted, tracing the black\\n thread with his eye. \\\"As long as\\n there is plenty of flimflam to distract\\n the viewer.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"If you don't have a black table, a\\n black cloth will do,\\\" the young man\\n said. \\\"And the arch of a doorway is a\\n good site, just see that the room in\\n back is dark.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Wrap it up, my boy, I wasn't born\\n yesterday.

The colonel was a good showman\\n and he had set the scene well.\\n He almost had them believing in the\\n Space Wave Tapper before he was\\n through. When the model had landed\\n and he had switched it off he couldn't\\n stop them from crowding around\\n the table.\\n\\n\\n \\\"A thread!\\\" one of the engineers\\n shouted, almost with relief, and they\\n all laughed along with him.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Too bad,\\\" the head project physicist\\n said, \\\"I was hoping that a little\\n Space Wave Tapping could help us\\n out. Let me try a flight with it.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Teddy Kaner first,\\\" Biff announced.\\n \\\"He spotted it while you\\n were all watching the flashing lights,\\n only he didn't say anything.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Kaner slipped the ring with the\\n black thread over his finger and started\\n to step back.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You have to turn the switch on\\n first,\\\" Biff said.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I know,\\\" Kaner smiled. \\\"But\\n that's part of illusion\\u2014the spiel and\\n the misdirection. I'm going to try\\n this cold first, so I can get it moving\\n up and down smoothly, then go\\n through it with the whole works.\\\"\\n\\nILLUSTRATED BY BREY\\n\\n He moved his hand back smoothly,\\n in a professional manner that drew\\n no attention to it. The model lifted\\n from the table\\u2014then crashed back\\n down.\\n\\n\\n \\\"The thread broke,\\\" Kaner said.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You jerked it, instead of pulling\\n smoothly,\\\" Biff said and knotted the\\n broken thread. \\\"Here let me show\\n you how to do it.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The thread broke again when Biff\\n tried it, which got a good laugh that\\n made his collar a little warm. Someone\\n mentioned the poker game.\\n\\n\\n This was the only time that poker\\n was mentioned or even remembered\\n that night. Because very soon after\\n this they found that the thread would\\n lift the model only when the switch\\n was on and two and a half volts\\n flowing through the joke coils. With\\n the current turned off the model was\\n too heavy to lift. The thread broke\\n every time.\\n\\\"I still think it's a screwy idea,\\\"\\n the young man said. \\\"One week getting\\n fallen arches, demonstrating\\n those toy ships for every brat within\\n a thousand miles. Then selling the\\n things for three bucks when they\\n must have cost at least a hundred dollars\\n apiece to make.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"But you\\ndid\\nsell the ten of them\\n to people who would be interested?\\\"\\n the older man asked.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I think so, I caught a few Air\\n Force officers and a colonel in missiles\\n one day.

Then those two professors\\n you spotted from the university.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Then the problem is out of our\\n hands and into theirs. All we have to\\n do now is sit back and wait for results.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nWhat\\nresults?! These people\\n weren't interested when we were\\n hammering on their doors with the\\n proof. We've patented the coils and\\n can prove to anyone that there is a\\n reduction in weight around them\\n when they are operating....\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"But a small reduction. And we\\n don't know what is causing it. No\\n one can be interested in a thing like\\n that\\u2014a fractional weight decrease in\\n a clumsy model, certainly not enough\\n to lift the weight of the generator.\\n No one wrapped up in massive fuel\\n consumption, tons of lift and such is\\n going to have time to worry about a\\n crackpot who thinks he has found a\\n minor slip in Newton's laws.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You think they will now?\\\" the\\n young man asked, cracking his knuckles\\n impatiently.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I\\nknow\\nthey will.
