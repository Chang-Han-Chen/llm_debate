For\\n instance, a whole beer bottle isn't half\\n the weapon that half a beer bottle is ...\\nIllustrated by Martinez\\nIn his\\n office apartment,\\n on the top floor of the\\n Terran Embassy Building\\n in Occeq City, Bertrand\\n Malloy leafed\\n casually through the dossiers of the\\n four new men who had been assigned\\n to him. They were typical of the kind\\n of men who were sent to him, he\\n thought. Which meant, as usual, that\\n they were atypical. Every man in the\\n Diplomatic Corps who developed a\\n twitch or a quirk was shipped to\\n Saarkkad IV to work under Bertrand\\n Malloy, Permanent Terran Ambassador\\n to His Utter Munificence, the\\n Occeq of Saarkkad.\\n\\n\\n Take this first one, for instance.\\n Malloy ran his finger down the columns\\n of complex symbolism that\\n showed the complete psychological\\n analysis of the man. Psychopathic\\n paranoia. The man wasn't technically\\n insane; he could be as lucid as the next\\n man most of the time. But he was\\n morbidly suspicious that every man's\\n hand was turned against him. He\\n trusted no one, and was perpetually\\n on his guard against imaginary plots\\n and persecutions.\\n\\n\\n Number two suffered from some\\n sort of emotional block that left him\\n continually on the horns of one dilemma\\n or another. He was psychologically\\n incapable of making a decision\\n if he were faced with two or more\\n possible alternatives of any major\\n importance.\\n\\n\\n Number three ...\\n\\n\\n Malloy sighed and pushed the dossiers\\n away from him. No two men\\n were alike, and yet there sometimes\\n seemed to be an eternal sameness\\n about all men. He considered himself\\n an individual, for instance, but wasn't\\n the basic similarity there, after all?\\n\\n\\n He was\\u2014how old? He glanced at\\n the Earth calendar dial that was automatically\\n correlated with the Saarkkadic\\n calendar just above it. Fifty-nine\\n next week. Fifty-nine years old. And\\n what did he have to show for it besides\\n flabby muscles, sagging skin, a\\n wrinkled face, and gray hair?\\n\\n\\n Well, he had an excellent record in\\n the Corps, if nothing else. One of the\\n top men in his field. And he had his\\n memories of Diane, dead these ten\\n years, but still beautiful and alive in\\n his recollections. And\\u2014he grinned\\n softly to himself\\u2014he had Saarkkad.\\n\\n\\n He glanced up at the ceiling, and\\n mentally allowed his gaze to penetrate\\n it to the blue sky beyond it.\\n\\n\\n Out there was the terrible emptiness\\n of interstellar space\\u2014a great, yawning,\\n infinite chasm capable of swallowing\\n men, ships, planets, suns, and\\n whole galaxies without filling its insatiable\\n void.\\n\\n\\n Malloy closed his eyes. Somewhere\\n out there, a war was raging. He\\n didn't even like to think of that, but\\n it was necessary to keep it in mind.\\n Somewhere out there, the ships of\\n Earth were ranged against the ships\\n of the alien Karna in the most important\\n war that Mankind had yet\\n fought.\\n\\n\\n And, Malloy knew, his own position\\n was not unimportant in that war.\\n He was not in the battle line, nor\\n even in the major production line, but\\n it was necessary to keep the drug supply\\n lines flowing from Saarkkad, and\\n that meant keeping on good terms\\n with the Saarkkadic government.\\n\\n\\n The Saarkkada themselves were humanoid\\n in physical form\\u2014if one allowed\\n the term to cover a wide range\\n of differences\\u2014but their minds just\\n didn't function along the same lines.\\n\\n\\n For nine years, Bertrand Malloy\\n had been Ambassador to Saarkkad,\\n and for nine years, no Saarkkada had\\n ever seen him. To have shown himself\\n to one of them would have\\n meant instant loss of prestige.\\n\\n\\n To their way of thinking, an important\\n official was aloof. The greater\\n his importance, the greater must be\\n his isolation. The Occeq of Saarkkad\\n himself was never seen except by a\\n handful of picked nobles, who, themselves,\\n were never seen except by their\\n underlings. It was a long, roundabout\\n way of doing business, but it was the\\n only way Saarkkad would do any\\n business at all. To violate the rigid\\n social setup of Saarkkad would mean\\n the instant closing off of the supply\\n of biochemical products that the\\n Saarkkadic laboratories produced\\n from native plants and animals\\u2014products\\n that were vitally necessary\\n to Earth's war, and which could be\\n duplicated nowhere else in the\\n known universe.\\n\\n\\n It was Bertrand Malloy's job to\\n keep the production output high and\\n to keep the materiel flowing towards\\n Earth and her allies and outposts.\\n\\n\\n The job would have been a snap\\n cinch in the right circumstances; the\\n Saarkkada weren't difficult to get\\n along with. A staff of top-grade men\\n could have handled them without\\n half trying.\\n\\n\\n But Malloy didn't have top-grade\\n men. They couldn't be spared from\\n work that required their total capacity.\\n It's inefficient to waste a man on a\\n job that he can do without half trying\\n where there are more important jobs\\n that will tax his full output.\\n\\n\\n So Malloy was stuck with the culls.\\n Not the worst ones, of course; there\\n were places in the galaxy that were\\n less important than Saarkkad to the\\n war effort. Malloy knew that, no matter\\n what was wrong with a man, as\\n long as he had the mental ability to\\n dress himself and get himself to\\n work, useful work could be found for\\n him.\\n\\n\\n Physical handicaps weren't at all\\n difficult to deal with. A blind man can\\n work very well in the total darkness\\n of an infrared-film darkroom. Partial\\n or total losses of limbs can be compensated\\n for in one way or another.\\n\\n\\n The mental disabilities were harder\\n to deal with, but not totally impossible.\\n On a world without liquor, a\\n dipsomaniac could be channeled easily\\n enough; and he'd better not try fermenting\\n his own on Saarkkad unless\\n he brought his own yeast\\u2014which\\n was impossible, in view of the sterilization\\n regulations.\\n\\n\\n But Malloy didn't like to stop at\\n merely thwarting mental quirks; he\\n liked to find places where they were\\nuseful\\n.\\nThe phone chimed. Malloy flipped\\n it on with a practiced hand.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Malloy here.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Mr. Malloy?\\\" said a careful voice.\\n \\\"A special communication for you has\\n been teletyped in from Earth. Shall I\\n bring it in?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Bring it in, Miss Drayson.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Miss Drayson was a case in point.\\n She was uncommunicative. She liked\\n to gather in information, but she\\n found it difficult to give it up once it\\n was in her possession.\\n\\n\\n Malloy had made her his private\\n secretary. Nothing\\u2014but\\nnothing\\n\\u2014got\\n out of Malloy's office without his\\n direct order. It had taken Malloy a\\n long time to get it into Miss Drayson's\\n head that it was perfectly all\\n right\\u2014even desirable\\u2014for her to\\n keep secrets from everyone except\\n Malloy.\\n\\n\\n She came in through the door,\\n a rather handsome woman in her middle\\n thirties, clutching a sheaf of\\n papers in her right hand as though\\n someone might at any instant snatch\\n it from her before she could turn it\\n over to Malloy.\\n\\n\\n She laid them carefully on the\\n desk. \\\"If anything else comes in, I'll\\n let you know immediately, sir,\\\" she\\n said. \\\"Will there be anything else?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Malloy let her stand there while he\\n picked up the communique. She wanted\\n to know what his reaction was\\n going to be; it didn't matter because\\n no one would ever find out from her\\n what he had done unless she was\\n ordered to tell someone.\\n\\n\\n He read the first paragraph, and his\\n eyes widened involuntarily.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Armistice,\\\" he said in a low\\n whisper. \\\"There's a chance that the\\n war may be over.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes, sir,\\\" said Miss Drayson in a\\n hushed voice.\\n\\n\\n Malloy read the whole thing\\n through, fighting to keep his emotions\\n in check. Miss Drayson stood\\n there calmly, her face a mask; her\\n emotions were a secret.\\n\\n\\n Finally, Malloy looked up. \\\"I'll let\\n you know as soon as I reach a decision,\\n Miss Drayson. I think I hardly\\n need say that no news of this is to\\n leave this office.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Of course not, sir.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Malloy watched her go out the door\\n without actually seeing her. The war\\n was over\\u2014at least for a while. He\\n looked down at the papers again.\\n\\n\\n The Karna, slowly being beaten\\n back on every front, were suing for\\n peace. They wanted an armistice conference\\u2014immediately.\\n\\n\\n Earth was willing. Interstellar war\\n is too costly to allow it to continue\\n any longer than necessary, and this\\n one had been going on for more than\\n thirteen years now. Peace was necessary.\\n But not peace at any price.\\n\\n\\n The trouble was that the Karna had\\n a reputation for losing wars and winning\\n at the peace table. They were\\n clever, persuasive talkers. They could\\n twist a disadvantage to an advantage,\\n and make their own strengths look\\n like weaknesses. If they won the armistice,\\n they'd be able to retrench and\\n rearm, and the war would break out\\n again within a few years.\\n\\n\\n Now\\u2014at this point in time\\u2014they\\n could be beaten. They could be forced\\n to allow supervision of the production\\n potential, forced to disarm, rendered\\n impotent. But if the armistice went to\\n their own advantage ...\\n\\n\\n Already, they had taken the offensive\\n in the matter of the peace talks.\\n They had sent a full delegation to\\n Saarkkad V, the next planet out from\\n the Saarkkad sun, a chilly world inhabited\\n only by low-intelligence animals.\\n The Karna considered this to be\\n fully neutral territory, and Earth\\n couldn't argue the point very well. In\\n addition, they demanded that the conference\\n begin in three days, Terrestrial\\n time.\\n\\n\\n The trouble was that interstellar\\n communication beams travel a devil\\n of a lot faster than ships. It would\\n take more than a week for the Earth\\n government to get a vessel to Saarkkad\\n V. Earth had been caught unprepared\\n for an armistice. They\\n objected.\\n\\n\\n The Karna pointed out that the\\n Saarkkad sun was just as far from\\n Karn as it was from Earth, that it\\n was only a few million miles from a\\n planet which was allied with Earth,\\n and that it was unfair for Earth to\\n take so much time in preparing for an\\n armistice. Why hadn't Earth been prepared?\\n Did they intend to fight to the\\n utter destruction of Karn?\\n\\n\\n It wouldn't have been a problem at\\n all if Earth and Karn had fostered the\\n only two intelligent races in the galaxy.\\n The sort of grandstanding the\\n Karna were putting on had to be\\n played to an audience. But there were\\n other intelligent races throughout the\\n galaxy, most of whom had remained\\n as neutral as possible during the\\n Earth-Karn war. They had no intention\\n of sticking their figurative noses\\n into a battle between the two most\\n powerful races in the galaxy.\\n\\n\\n But whoever won the armistice\\n would find that some of the now-neutral\\n races would come in on their\\n side if war broke out again. If the\\n Karna played their cards right, their\\n side would be strong enough next\\n time to win.\\n\\n\\n So Earth had to get a delegation to\\n meet with the Karna representatives\\n within the three-day limit or lose what\\n might be a vital point in the negotiations.\\n\\n\\n And that was where Bertrand Malloy\\n came in.\\n\\n\\n He had been appointed Minister\\n and Plenipotentiary Extraordinary to\\n the Earth-Karn peace conference.\\n\\n\\n He looked up at the ceiling again.\\n \\\"What\\ncan\\nI do?\\\" he said softly.\\nOn the second day after the arrival\\n of the communique, Malloy\\n made his decision. He flipped on his\\n intercom and said: \\\"Miss Drayson,\\n get hold of James Nordon and Kylen\\n Braynek. I want to see them both immediately.\\n Send Nordon in first, and\\n tell Braynek to wait.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes, sir.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"And keep the recorder on. You\\n can file the tape later.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes, sir.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Malloy knew the woman would\\n listen in on the intercom anyway, and\\n it was better to give her permission to\\n do so.\\n\\n\\n James Nordon was tall, broad-shouldered,\\n and thirty-eight. His hair\\n was graying at the temples, and his\\n handsome face looked cool and efficient.\\n\\n\\n Malloy waved him to a seat.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Nordon, I have a job for you. It's\\n probably one of the most important\\n jobs you'll ever have in your life. It\\n can mean big things for you\\u2014promotion\\n and prestige if you do it well.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Nordon nodded slowly. \\\"Yes, sir.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Malloy explained the problem of\\n the Karna peace talks.\\n\\n\\n \\\"We need a man who can outthink\\n them,\\\" Malloy finished, \\\"and judging\\n from your record, I think you're that\\n man. It involves risk, of course. If\\n you make the wrong decisions, your\\n name will be mud back on Earth. But\\n I don't think there's much chance of\\n that, really. Do you want to handle\\n small-time operations all your life?\\n Of course not.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You'll be leaving within an hour\\n for Saarkkad V.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Nordon nodded again. \\\"Yes, sir;\\n certainly. Am I to go alone?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"No,\\\" said Malloy, \\\"I'm sending\\n an assistant with you\\u2014a man named\\n Kylen Braynek. Ever heard of him?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Nordon shook his head. \\\"Not that\\n I recall, Mr. Malloy. Should I have?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Not necessarily. He's a pretty\\n shrewd operator, though. He knows a\\n lot about interstellar law, and he's\\n capable of spotting a trap a mile away.\\n You'll be in charge, of course, but I\\n want you to pay special attention to\\n his advice.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I will, sir,\\\" Nordon said gratefully.\\n \\\"A man like that can be useful.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Right. Now, you go into the anteroom\\n over there. I've prepared a summary\\n of the situation, and you'll have\\n to study it and get it into your head\\n before the ship leaves. That isn't\\n much time, but it's the Karna who are\\n doing the pushing, not us.\\\"\\n\\n\\n As soon as Nordon had left, Malloy\\n said softly: \\\"Send in Braynek,\\n Miss Drayson.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Kylen Braynek was a smallish man\\n with mouse-brown hair that lay flat\\n against his skull, and hard, penetrating,\\n dark eyes that were shadowed by\\n heavy, protruding brows. Malloy asked\\n him to sit down.\\n\\n\\n Again Malloy went through the explanation\\n of the peace conference.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Naturally, they'll be trying to\\n trick you every step of the way,\\\" Malloy\\n went on. \\\"They're shrewd and\\n underhanded; we'll simply have to\\n be more shrewd and more underhanded.\\n Nordon's job is to sit\\n quietly and evaluate the data; yours\\n will be to find the loopholes they're\\n laying out for themselves and plug\\n them. Don't antagonize them, but\\n don't baby them, either. If you see\\n anything underhanded going on, let\\n Nordon know immediately.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"They won't get anything by me,\\n Mr. Malloy.\\\"\\nBy the time the ship from Earth\\n got there, the peace conference had\\n been going on for four days. Bertrand\\n Malloy had full reports on the whole\\n parley, as relayed to him through the\\n ship that had taken Nordon and Braynek\\n to Saarkkad V.\\n\\n\\n Secretary of State Blendwell stopped\\n off at Saarkkad IV before going\\n on to V to take charge of the conference.\\n He was a tallish, lean man with\\n a few strands of gray hair on the top\\n of his otherwise bald scalp, and he\\n wore a hearty, professional smile that\\n didn't quite make it to his calculating\\n eyes.\\n\\n\\n He took Malloy's hand and shook\\n it warmly. \\\"How are you, Mr. Ambassador?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Fine, Mr. Secretary. How's everything\\n on Earth?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Tense. They're waiting to see\\n what is going to happen on Five. So\\n am I, for that matter.\\\" His eyes were\\n curious. \\\"You decided not to go\\n yourself, eh?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I thought it better not to. I sent a\\n good team, instead. Would you like\\n to see the reports?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I certainly would.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Malloy handed them to the secretary,\\n and as he read, Malloy watched\\n him. Blendwell was a political appointee\\u2014a\\n good man, Malloy had to\\n admit, but he didn't know all the\\n ins and outs of the Diplomatic Corps.\\n\\n\\n When Blendwell looked up from\\n the reports at last, he said: \\\"Amazing!\\n They've held off the Karna at\\n every point! They've beaten them\\n back! They've managed to cope with\\n and outdo the finest team of negotiators\\n the Karna could send.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I thought they would,\\\" said Malloy,\\n trying to appear modest.\\n\\n\\n The secretary's eyes narrowed.\\n \\\"I've heard of the work you've been\\n doing here with ... ah ... sick men.\\n Is this one of your ... ah ... successes?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Malloy nodded. \\\"I think so. The\\n Karna put us in a dilemma, so I\\n threw a dilemma right back at them.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"How do you mean?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Nordon had a mental block\\n against making decisions. If he took\\n a girl out on a date, he'd have trouble\\n making up his mind whether to kiss\\n her or not until she made up his mind\\n for him, one way or the other. He's\\n that kind of guy. Until he's presented\\n with one, single, clear decision which\\n admits of no alternatives, he can't\\n move at all.\\n\\n\\n \\\"As you can see, the Karna tried\\n to give us several choices on each\\n point, and they were all rigged. Until\\n they backed down to a single point\\n and proved that it\\nwasn't\\nrigged,\\n Nordon couldn't possibly make up his\\n mind. I drummed into him how important\\n this was, and the more importance\\n there is attached to his decisions,\\n the more incapable he becomes\\n of making them.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The Secretary nodded slowly.\\n \\\"What about Braynek?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Paranoid,\\\" said Malloy. \\\"He\\n thinks everyone is plotting against\\n him. In this case, that's all to the good\\n because the Karna\\nare\\nplotting against\\n him. No matter what they put forth,\\n Braynek is convinced that there's a\\n trap in it somewhere, and he digs to\\n find out what the trap is. Even if\\n there isn't a trap, the Karna can't\\n satisfy Braynek, because he's convinced\\n that there\\nhas\\nto be\\u2014somewhere.\\n As a result, all his advice to\\n Nordon, and all his questioning on\\n the wildest possibilities, just serves\\n to keep Nordon from getting unconfused.\\n\\n\\n \\\"These two men are honestly doing\\n their best to win at the peace conference,\\n and they've got the Karna reeling.\\n The Karna can see that we're not\\n trying to stall; our men are actually\\n working at trying to reach a decision.\\n But what the Karna don't see is that\\n those men, as a team, are unbeatable\\n because, in this situation, they're psychologically\\n incapable of losing.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Again the Secretary of State nodded\\n his approval, but there was still\\n a question in his mind. \\\"Since you\\n know all that, couldn't you have handled\\n it yourself?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Maybe, but I doubt it. They might\\n have gotten around me someway by\\n sneaking up on a blind spot. Nordon\\n and Braynek have blind spots, but\\n they're covered with armor. No, I'm\\n glad I couldn't go; it's better this\\n way.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The Secretary of State raised an\\n eyebrow. \\\"\\nCouldn't\\ngo, Mr. Ambassador?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Malloy looked at him. \\\"Didn't you\\n know? I wondered why you appointed\\n me, in the first place. No, I\\n couldn't go.

Furthermore, the narrative describes, <quote>\\\"The Karna, slowly being beaten back on every front\\\"</quote>, emphasizing their role as aggressors in this war.

The Karna's reputation for being skilled negotiators does not counteract their characterization as adversarial warriors. 3.

For\\n instance, a whole beer bottle isn't half\\n the weapon that half a beer bottle is ...\\nIllustrated by Martinez\\nIn his\\n office apartment,\\n on the top floor of the\\n Terran Embassy Building\\n in Occeq City, Bertrand\\n Malloy leafed\\n casually through the dossiers of the\\n four new men who had been assigned\\n to him. They were typical of the kind\\n of men who were sent to him, he\\n thought. Which meant, as usual, that\\n they were atypical. Every man in the\\n Diplomatic Corps who developed a\\n twitch or a quirk was shipped to\\n Saarkkad IV to work under Bertrand\\n Malloy, Permanent Terran Ambassador\\n to His Utter Munificence, the\\n Occeq of Saarkkad.\\n\\n\\n Take this first one, for instance.\\n Malloy ran his finger down the columns\\n of complex symbolism that\\n showed the complete psychological\\n analysis of the man. Psychopathic\\n paranoia. The man wasn't technically\\n insane; he could be as lucid as the next\\n man most of the time. But he was\\n morbidly suspicious that every man's\\n hand was turned against him. He\\n trusted no one, and was perpetually\\n on his guard against imaginary plots\\n and persecutions.\\n\\n\\n Number two suffered from some\\n sort of emotional block that left him\\n continually on the horns of one dilemma\\n or another. He was psychologically\\n incapable of making a decision\\n if he were faced with two or more\\n possible alternatives of any major\\n importance.\\n\\n\\n Number three ...\\n\\n\\n Malloy sighed and pushed the dossiers\\n away from him. No two men\\n were alike, and yet there sometimes\\n seemed to be an eternal sameness\\n about all men. He considered himself\\n an individual, for instance, but wasn't\\n the basic similarity there, after all?\\n\\n\\n He was\\u2014how old? He glanced at\\n the Earth calendar dial that was automatically\\n correlated with the Saarkkadic\\n calendar just above it. Fifty-nine\\n next week. Fifty-nine years old. And\\n what did he have to show for it besides\\n flabby muscles, sagging skin, a\\n wrinkled face, and gray hair?\\n\\n\\n Well, he had an excellent record in\\n the Corps, if nothing else. One of the\\n top men in his field. And he had his\\n memories of Diane, dead these ten\\n years, but still beautiful and alive in\\n his recollections. And\\u2014he grinned\\n softly to himself\\u2014he had Saarkkad.\\n\\n\\n He glanced up at the ceiling, and\\n mentally allowed his gaze to penetrate\\n it to the blue sky beyond it.\\n\\n\\n Out there was the terrible emptiness\\n of interstellar space\\u2014a great, yawning,\\n infinite chasm capable of swallowing\\n men, ships, planets, suns, and\\n whole galaxies without filling its insatiable\\n void.\\n\\n\\n Malloy closed his eyes. Somewhere\\n out there, a war was raging. He\\n didn't even like to think of that, but\\n it was necessary to keep it in mind.\\n Somewhere out there, the ships of\\n Earth were ranged against the ships\\n of the alien Karna in the most important\\n war that Mankind had yet\\n fought.\\n\\n\\n And, Malloy knew, his own position\\n was not unimportant in that war.\\n He was not in the battle line, nor\\n even in the major production line, but\\n it was necessary to keep the drug supply\\n lines flowing from Saarkkad, and\\n that meant keeping on good terms\\n with the Saarkkadic government.\\n\\n\\n The Saarkkada themselves were humanoid\\n in physical form\\u2014if one allowed\\n the term to cover a wide range\\n of differences\\u2014but their minds just\\n didn't function along the same lines.\\n\\n\\n For nine years, Bertrand Malloy\\n had been Ambassador to Saarkkad,\\n and for nine years, no Saarkkada had\\n ever seen him. To have shown himself\\n to one of them would have\\n meant instant loss of prestige.\\n\\n\\n To their way of thinking, an important\\n official was aloof. The greater\\n his importance, the greater must be\\n his isolation. The Occeq of Saarkkad\\n himself was never seen except by a\\n handful of picked nobles, who, themselves,\\n were never seen except by their\\n underlings. It was a long, roundabout\\n way of doing business, but it was the\\n only way Saarkkad would do any\\n business at all. To violate the rigid\\n social setup of Saarkkad would mean\\n the instant closing off of the supply\\n of biochemical products that the\\n Saarkkadic laboratories produced\\n from native plants and animals\\u2014products\\n that were vitally necessary\\n to Earth's war, and which could be\\n duplicated nowhere else in the\\n known universe.\\n\\n\\n It was Bertrand Malloy's job to\\n keep the production output high and\\n to keep the materiel flowing towards\\n Earth and her allies and outposts.\\n\\n\\n The job would have been a snap\\n cinch in the right circumstances; the\\n Saarkkada weren't difficult to get\\n along with. A staff of top-grade men\\n could have handled them without\\n half trying.\\n\\n\\n But Malloy didn't have top-grade\\n men. They couldn't be spared from\\n work that required their total capacity.\\n It's inefficient to waste a man on a\\n job that he can do without half trying\\n where there are more important jobs\\n that will tax his full output.\\n\\n\\n So Malloy was stuck with the culls.\\n Not the worst ones, of course; there\\n were places in the galaxy that were\\n less important than Saarkkad to the\\n war effort. Malloy knew that, no matter\\n what was wrong with a man, as\\n long as he had the mental ability to\\n dress himself and get himself to\\n work, useful work could be found for\\n him.\\n\\n\\n Physical handicaps weren't at all\\n difficult to deal with. A blind man can\\n work very well in the total darkness\\n of an infrared-film darkroom. Partial\\n or total losses of limbs can be compensated\\n for in one way or another.\\n\\n\\n The mental disabilities were harder\\n to deal with, but not totally impossible.\\n On a world without liquor, a\\n dipsomaniac could be channeled easily\\n enough; and he'd better not try fermenting\\n his own on Saarkkad unless\\n he brought his own yeast\\u2014which\\n was impossible, in view of the sterilization\\n regulations.\\n\\n\\n But Malloy didn't like to stop at\\n merely thwarting mental quirks; he\\n liked to find places where they were\\nuseful\\n.\\nThe phone chimed. Malloy flipped\\n it on with a practiced hand.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Malloy here.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Mr. Malloy?\\\" said a careful voice.\\n \\\"A special communication for you has\\n been teletyped in from Earth. Shall I\\n bring it in?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Bring it in, Miss Drayson.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Miss Drayson was a case in point.\\n She was uncommunicative. She liked\\n to gather in information, but she\\n found it difficult to give it up once it\\n was in her possession.\\n\\n\\n Malloy had made her his private\\n secretary. Nothing\\u2014but\\nnothing\\n\\u2014got\\n out of Malloy's office without his\\n direct order. It had taken Malloy a\\n long time to get it into Miss Drayson's\\n head that it was perfectly all\\n right\\u2014even desirable\\u2014for her to\\n keep secrets from everyone except\\n Malloy.\\n\\n\\n She came in through the door,\\n a rather handsome woman in her middle\\n thirties, clutching a sheaf of\\n papers in her right hand as though\\n someone might at any instant snatch\\n it from her before she could turn it\\n over to Malloy.\\n\\n\\n She laid them carefully on the\\n desk. \\\"If anything else comes in, I'll\\n let you know immediately, sir,\\\" she\\n said. \\\"Will there be anything else?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Malloy let her stand there while he\\n picked up the communique. She wanted\\n to know what his reaction was\\n going to be; it didn't matter because\\n no one would ever find out from her\\n what he had done unless she was\\n ordered to tell someone.\\n\\n\\n He read the first paragraph, and his\\n eyes widened involuntarily.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Armistice,\\\" he said in a low\\n whisper. \\\"There's a chance that the\\n war may be over.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes, sir,\\\" said Miss Drayson in a\\n hushed voice.\\n\\n\\n Malloy read the whole thing\\n through, fighting to keep his emotions\\n in check. Miss Drayson stood\\n there calmly, her face a mask; her\\n emotions were a secret.\\n\\n\\n Finally, Malloy looked up. \\\"I'll let\\n you know as soon as I reach a decision,\\n Miss Drayson. I think I hardly\\n need say that no news of this is to\\n leave this office.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Of course not, sir.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Malloy watched her go out the door\\n without actually seeing her. The war\\n was over\\u2014at least for a while. He\\n looked down at the papers again.\\n\\n\\n The Karna, slowly being beaten\\n back on every front, were suing for\\n peace. They wanted an armistice conference\\u2014immediately.\\n\\n\\n Earth was willing. Interstellar war\\n is too costly to allow it to continue\\n any longer than necessary, and this\\n one had been going on for more than\\n thirteen years now. Peace was necessary.\\n But not peace at any price.\\n\\n\\n The trouble was that the Karna had\\n a reputation for losing wars and winning\\n at the peace table. They were\\n clever, persuasive talkers. They could\\n twist a disadvantage to an advantage,\\n and make their own strengths look\\n like weaknesses. If they won the armistice,\\n they'd be able to retrench and\\n rearm, and the war would break out\\n again within a few years.\\n\\n\\n Now\\u2014at this point in time\\u2014they\\n could be beaten. They could be forced\\n to allow supervision of the production\\n potential, forced to disarm, rendered\\n impotent. But if the armistice went to\\n their own advantage ...\\n\\n\\n Already, they had taken the offensive\\n in the matter of the peace talks.\\n They had sent a full delegation to\\n Saarkkad V, the next planet out from\\n the Saarkkad sun, a chilly world inhabited\\n only by low-intelligence animals.\\n The Karna considered this to be\\n fully neutral territory, and Earth\\n couldn't argue the point very well. In\\n addition, they demanded that the conference\\n begin in three days, Terrestrial\\n time.\\n\\n\\n The trouble was that interstellar\\n communication beams travel a devil\\n of a lot faster than ships. It would\\n take more than a week for the Earth\\n government to get a vessel to Saarkkad\\n V. Earth had been caught unprepared\\n for an armistice. They\\n objected.\\n\\n\\n The Karna pointed out that the\\n Saarkkad sun was just as far from\\n Karn as it was from Earth, that it\\n was only a few million miles from a\\n planet which was allied with Earth,\\n and that it was unfair for Earth to\\n take so much time in preparing for an\\n armistice. Why hadn't Earth been prepared?\\n Did they intend to fight to the\\n utter destruction of Karn?\\n\\n\\n It wouldn't have been a problem at\\n all if Earth and Karn had fostered the\\n only two intelligent races in the galaxy.\\n The sort of grandstanding the\\n Karna were putting on had to be\\n played to an audience. But there were\\n other intelligent races throughout the\\n galaxy, most of whom had remained\\n as neutral as possible during the\\n Earth-Karn war. They had no intention\\n of sticking their figurative noses\\n into a battle between the two most\\n powerful races in the galaxy.\\n\\n\\n But whoever won the armistice\\n would find that some of the now-neutral\\n races would come in on their\\n side if war broke out again. If the\\n Karna played their cards right, their\\n side would be strong enough next\\n time to win.\\n\\n\\n So Earth had to get a delegation to\\n meet with the Karna representatives\\n within the three-day limit or lose what\\n might be a vital point in the negotiations.\\n\\n\\n And that was where Bertrand Malloy\\n came in.\\n\\n\\n He had been appointed Minister\\n and Plenipotentiary Extraordinary to\\n the Earth-Karn peace conference.\\n\\n\\n He looked up at the ceiling again.\\n \\\"What\\ncan\\nI do?\\\" he said softly.\\nOn the second day after the arrival\\n of the communique, Malloy\\n made his decision. He flipped on his\\n intercom and said: \\\"Miss Drayson,\\n get hold of James Nordon and Kylen\\n Braynek. I want to see them both immediately.\\n Send Nordon in first, and\\n tell Braynek to wait.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes, sir.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"And keep the recorder on. You\\n can file the tape later.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes, sir.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Malloy knew the woman would\\n listen in on the intercom anyway, and\\n it was better to give her permission to\\n do so.\\n\\n\\n James Nordon was tall, broad-shouldered,\\n and thirty-eight. His hair\\n was graying at the temples, and his\\n handsome face looked cool and efficient.\\n\\n\\n Malloy waved him to a seat.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Nordon, I have a job for you. It's\\n probably one of the most important\\n jobs you'll ever have in your life. It\\n can mean big things for you\\u2014promotion\\n and prestige if you do it well.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Nordon nodded slowly. \\\"Yes, sir.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Malloy explained the problem of\\n the Karna peace talks.\\n\\n\\n \\\"We need a man who can outthink\\n them,\\\" Malloy finished, \\\"and judging\\n from your record, I think you're that\\n man. It involves risk, of course. If\\n you make the wrong decisions, your\\n name will be mud back on Earth. But\\n I don't think there's much chance of\\n that, really. Do you want to handle\\n small-time operations all your life?\\n Of course not.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You'll be leaving within an hour\\n for Saarkkad V.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Nordon nodded again. \\\"Yes, sir;\\n certainly. Am I to go alone?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"No,\\\" said Malloy, \\\"I'm sending\\n an assistant with you\\u2014a man named\\n Kylen Braynek. Ever heard of him?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Nordon shook his head. \\\"Not that\\n I recall, Mr. Malloy. Should I have?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Not necessarily. He's a pretty\\n shrewd operator, though. He knows a\\n lot about interstellar law, and he's\\n capable of spotting a trap a mile away.\\n You'll be in charge, of course, but I\\n want you to pay special attention to\\n his advice.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I will, sir,\\\" Nordon said gratefully.\\n \\\"A man like that can be useful.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Right. Now, you go into the anteroom\\n over there. I've prepared a summary\\n of the situation, and you'll have\\n to study it and get it into your head\\n before the ship leaves. That isn't\\n much time, but it's the Karna who are\\n doing the pushing, not us.\\\"\\n\\n\\n As soon as Nordon had left, Malloy\\n said softly: \\\"Send in Braynek,\\n Miss Drayson.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Kylen Braynek was a smallish man\\n with mouse-brown hair that lay flat\\n against his skull, and hard, penetrating,\\n dark eyes that were shadowed by\\n heavy, protruding brows. Malloy asked\\n him to sit down.\\n\\n\\n Again Malloy went through the explanation\\n of the peace conference.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Naturally, they'll be trying to\\n trick you every step of the way,\\\" Malloy\\n went on. \\\"They're shrewd and\\n underhanded; we'll simply have to\\n be more shrewd and more underhanded.\\n Nordon's job is to sit\\n quietly and evaluate the data; yours\\n will be to find the loopholes they're\\n laying out for themselves and plug\\n them. Don't antagonize them, but\\n don't baby them, either. If you see\\n anything underhanded going on, let\\n Nordon know immediately.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"They won't get anything by me,\\n Mr. Malloy.\\\"\\nBy the time the ship from Earth\\n got there, the peace conference had\\n been going on for four days. Bertrand\\n Malloy had full reports on the whole\\n parley, as relayed to him through the\\n ship that had taken Nordon and Braynek\\n to Saarkkad V.\\n\\n\\n Secretary of State Blendwell stopped\\n off at Saarkkad IV before going\\n on to V to take charge of the conference.\\n He was a tallish, lean man with\\n a few strands of gray hair on the top\\n of his otherwise bald scalp, and he\\n wore a hearty, professional smile that\\n didn't quite make it to his calculating\\n eyes.\\n\\n\\n He took Malloy's hand and shook\\n it warmly. \\\"How are you, Mr. Ambassador?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Fine, Mr. Secretary. How's everything\\n on Earth?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Tense. They're waiting to see\\n what is going to happen on Five. So\\n am I, for that matter.\\\" His eyes were\\n curious. \\\"You decided not to go\\n yourself, eh?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I thought it better not to. I sent a\\n good team, instead. Would you like\\n to see the reports?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I certainly would.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Malloy handed them to the secretary,\\n and as he read, Malloy watched\\n him. Blendwell was a political appointee\\u2014a\\n good man, Malloy had to\\n admit, but he didn't know all the\\n ins and outs of the Diplomatic Corps.\\n\\n\\n When Blendwell looked up from\\n the reports at last, he said: \\\"Amazing!\\n They've held off the Karna at\\n every point! They've beaten them\\n back! They've managed to cope with\\n and outdo the finest team of negotiators\\n the Karna could send.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I thought they would,\\\" said Malloy,\\n trying to appear modest.\\n\\n\\n The secretary's eyes narrowed.\\n \\\"I've heard of the work you've been\\n doing here with ... ah ... sick men.\\n Is this one of your ... ah ... successes?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Malloy nodded. \\\"I think so. The\\n Karna put us in a dilemma, so I\\n threw a dilemma right back at them.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"How do you mean?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Nordon had a mental block\\n against making decisions. If he took\\n a girl out on a date, he'd have trouble\\n making up his mind whether to kiss\\n her or not until she made up his mind\\n for him, one way or the other. He's\\n that kind of guy. Until he's presented\\n with one, single, clear decision which\\n admits of no alternatives, he can't\\n move at all.\\n\\n\\n \\\"As you can see, the Karna tried\\n to give us several choices on each\\n point, and they were all rigged. Until\\n they backed down to a single point\\n and proved that it\\nwasn't\\nrigged,\\n Nordon couldn't possibly make up his\\n mind. I drummed into him how important\\n this was, and the more importance\\n there is attached to his decisions,\\n the more incapable he becomes\\n of making them.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The Secretary nodded slowly.\\n \\\"What about Braynek?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Paranoid,\\\" said Malloy. \\\"He\\n thinks everyone is plotting against\\n him. In this case, that's all to the good\\n because the Karna\\nare\\nplotting against\\n him. No matter what they put forth,\\n Braynek is convinced that there's a\\n trap in it somewhere, and he digs to\\n find out what the trap is. Even if\\n there isn't a trap, the Karna can't\\n satisfy Braynek, because he's convinced\\n that there\\nhas\\nto be\\u2014somewhere.\\n As a result, all his advice to\\n Nordon, and all his questioning on\\n the wildest possibilities, just serves\\n to keep Nordon from getting unconfused.\\n\\n\\n \\\"These two men are honestly doing\\n their best to win at the peace conference,\\n and they've got the Karna reeling.\\n The Karna can see that we're not\\n trying to stall; our men are actually\\n working at trying to reach a decision.\\n But what the Karna don't see is that\\n those men, as a team, are unbeatable\\n because, in this situation, they're psychologically\\n incapable of losing.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Again the Secretary of State nodded\\n his approval, but there was still\\n a question in his mind. \\\"Since you\\n know all that, couldn't you have handled\\n it yourself?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Maybe, but I doubt it. They might\\n have gotten around me someway by\\n sneaking up on a blind spot. Nordon\\n and Braynek have blind spots, but\\n they're covered with armor. No, I'm\\n glad I couldn't go; it's better this\\n way.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The Secretary of State raised an\\n eyebrow. \\\"\\nCouldn't\\ngo, Mr. Ambassador?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Malloy looked at him. \\\"Didn't you\\n know? I wondered why you appointed\\n me, in the first place. No, I\\n couldn't go. The reason why I'm here,\\n cooped up in this office, hiding from\\n the Saarkkada the way a good Saarkkadic\\n bigshot should, is because I\\nlike\\nit that way.

For\\n instance, a whole beer bottle isn't half\\n the weapon that half a beer bottle is ...\\nIllustrated by Martinez\\nIn his\\n office apartment,\\n on the top floor of the\\n Terran Embassy Building\\n in Occeq City, Bertrand\\n Malloy leafed\\n casually through the dossiers of the\\n four new men who had been assigned\\n to him. They were typical of the kind\\n of men who were sent to him, he\\n thought. Which meant, as usual, that\\n they were atypical. Every man in the\\n Diplomatic Corps who developed a\\n twitch or a quirk was shipped to\\n Saarkkad IV to work under Bertrand\\n Malloy, Permanent Terran Ambassador\\n to His Utter Munificence, the\\n Occeq of Saarkkad.\\n\\n\\n Take this first one, for instance.\\n Malloy ran his finger down the columns\\n of complex symbolism that\\n showed the complete psychological\\n analysis of the man. Psychopathic\\n paranoia. The man wasn't technically\\n insane; he could be as lucid as the next\\n man most of the time. But he was\\n morbidly suspicious that every man's\\n hand was turned against him. He\\n trusted no one, and was perpetually\\n on his guard against imaginary plots\\n and persecutions.\\n\\n\\n Number two suffered from some\\n sort of emotional block that left him\\n continually on the horns of one dilemma\\n or another. He was psychologically\\n incapable of making a decision\\n if he were faced with two or more\\n possible alternatives of any major\\n importance.\\n\\n\\n Number three ...\\n\\n\\n Malloy sighed and pushed the dossiers\\n away from him. No two men\\n were alike, and yet there sometimes\\n seemed to be an eternal sameness\\n about all men. He considered himself\\n an individual, for instance, but wasn't\\n the basic similarity there, after all?\\n\\n\\n He was\\u2014how old? He glanced at\\n the Earth calendar dial that was automatically\\n correlated with the Saarkkadic\\n calendar just above it. Fifty-nine\\n next week. Fifty-nine years old. And\\n what did he have to show for it besides\\n flabby muscles, sagging skin, a\\n wrinkled face, and gray hair?\\n\\n\\n Well, he had an excellent record in\\n the Corps, if nothing else. One of the\\n top men in his field. And he had his\\n memories of Diane, dead these ten\\n years, but still beautiful and alive in\\n his recollections. And\\u2014he grinned\\n softly to himself\\u2014he had Saarkkad.\\n\\n\\n He glanced up at the ceiling, and\\n mentally allowed his gaze to penetrate\\n it to the blue sky beyond it.\\n\\n\\n Out there was the terrible emptiness\\n of interstellar space\\u2014a great, yawning,\\n infinite chasm capable of swallowing\\n men, ships, planets, suns, and\\n whole galaxies without filling its insatiable\\n void.\\n\\n\\n Malloy closed his eyes. Somewhere\\n out there, a war was raging. He\\n didn't even like to think of that, but\\n it was necessary to keep it in mind.\\n Somewhere out there, the ships of\\n Earth were ranged against the ships\\n of the alien Karna in the most important\\n war that Mankind had yet\\n fought.\\n\\n\\n And, Malloy knew, his own position\\n was not unimportant in that war.\\n He was not in the battle line, nor\\n even in the major production line, but\\n it was necessary to keep the drug supply\\n lines flowing from Saarkkad, and\\n that meant keeping on good terms\\n with the Saarkkadic government.\\n\\n\\n The Saarkkada themselves were humanoid\\n in physical form\\u2014if one allowed\\n the term to cover a wide range\\n of differences\\u2014but their minds just\\n didn't function along the same lines.\\n\\n\\n For nine years, Bertrand Malloy\\n had been Ambassador to Saarkkad,\\n and for nine years, no Saarkkada had\\n ever seen him. To have shown himself\\n to one of them would have\\n meant instant loss of prestige.\\n\\n\\n To their way of thinking, an important\\n official was aloof. The greater\\n his importance, the greater must be\\n his isolation. The Occeq of Saarkkad\\n himself was never seen except by a\\n handful of picked nobles, who, themselves,\\n were never seen except by their\\n underlings. It was a long, roundabout\\n way of doing business, but it was the\\n only way Saarkkad would do any\\n business at all. To violate the rigid\\n social setup of Saarkkad would mean\\n the instant closing off of the supply\\n of biochemical products that the\\n Saarkkadic laboratories produced\\n from native plants and animals\\u2014products\\n that were vitally necessary\\n to Earth's war, and which could be\\n duplicated nowhere else in the\\n known universe.\\n\\n\\n It was Bertrand Malloy's job to\\n keep the production output high and\\n to keep the materiel flowing towards\\n Earth and her allies and outposts.\\n\\n\\n The job would have been a snap\\n cinch in the right circumstances; the\\n Saarkkada weren't difficult to get\\n along with. A staff of top-grade men\\n could have handled them without\\n half trying.\\n\\n\\n But Malloy didn't have top-grade\\n men. They couldn't be spared from\\n work that required their total capacity.\\n It's inefficient to waste a man on a\\n job that he can do without half trying\\n where there are more important jobs\\n that will tax his full output.\\n\\n\\n So Malloy was stuck with the culls.\\n Not the worst ones, of course; there\\n were places in the galaxy that were\\n less important than Saarkkad to the\\n war effort. Malloy knew that, no matter\\n what was wrong with a man, as\\n long as he had the mental ability to\\n dress himself and get himself to\\n work, useful work could be found for\\n him.\\n\\n\\n Physical handicaps weren't at all\\n difficult to deal with. A blind man can\\n work very well in the total darkness\\n of an infrared-film darkroom. Partial\\n or total losses of limbs can be compensated\\n for in one way or another.\\n\\n\\n The mental disabilities were harder\\n to deal with, but not totally impossible.\\n On a world without liquor, a\\n dipsomaniac could be channeled easily\\n enough; and he'd better not try fermenting\\n his own on Saarkkad unless\\n he brought his own yeast\\u2014which\\n was impossible, in view of the sterilization\\n regulations.\\n\\n\\n But Malloy didn't like to stop at\\n merely thwarting mental quirks; he\\n liked to find places where they were\\nuseful\\n.\\nThe phone chimed. Malloy flipped\\n it on with a practiced hand.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Malloy here.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Mr. Malloy?\\\" said a careful voice.\\n \\\"A special communication for you has\\n been teletyped in from Earth. Shall I\\n bring it in?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Bring it in, Miss Drayson.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Miss Drayson was a case in point.\\n She was uncommunicative. She liked\\n to gather in information, but she\\n found it difficult to give it up once it\\n was in her possession.\\n\\n\\n Malloy had made her his private\\n secretary. Nothing\\u2014but\\nnothing\\n\\u2014got\\n out of Malloy's office without his\\n direct order. It had taken Malloy a\\n long time to get it into Miss Drayson's\\n head that it was perfectly all\\n right\\u2014even desirable\\u2014for her to\\n keep secrets from everyone except\\n Malloy.\\n\\n\\n She came in through the door,\\n a rather handsome woman in her middle\\n thirties, clutching a sheaf of\\n papers in her right hand as though\\n someone might at any instant snatch\\n it from her before she could turn it\\n over to Malloy.\\n\\n\\n She laid them carefully on the\\n desk. \\\"If anything else comes in, I'll\\n let you know immediately, sir,\\\" she\\n said. \\\"Will there be anything else?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Malloy let her stand there while he\\n picked up the communique. She wanted\\n to know what his reaction was\\n going to be; it didn't matter because\\n no one would ever find out from her\\n what he had done unless she was\\n ordered to tell someone.\\n\\n\\n He read the first paragraph, and his\\n eyes widened involuntarily.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Armistice,\\\" he said in a low\\n whisper. \\\"There's a chance that the\\n war may be over.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes, sir,\\\" said Miss Drayson in a\\n hushed voice.\\n\\n\\n Malloy read the whole thing\\n through, fighting to keep his emotions\\n in check. Miss Drayson stood\\n there calmly, her face a mask; her\\n emotions were a secret.\\n\\n\\n Finally, Malloy looked up. \\\"I'll let\\n you know as soon as I reach a decision,\\n Miss Drayson. I think I hardly\\n need say that no news of this is to\\n leave this office.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Of course not, sir.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Malloy watched her go out the door\\n without actually seeing her. The war\\n was over\\u2014at least for a while. He\\n looked down at the papers again.\\n\\n\\n The Karna, slowly being beaten\\n back on every front, were suing for\\n peace. They wanted an armistice conference\\u2014immediately.\\n\\n\\n Earth was willing. Interstellar war\\n is too costly to allow it to continue\\n any longer than necessary, and this\\n one had been going on for more than\\n thirteen years now. Peace was necessary.\\n But not peace at any price.\\n\\n\\n The trouble was that the Karna had\\n a reputation for losing wars and winning\\n at the peace table. They were\\n clever, persuasive talkers. They could\\n twist a disadvantage to an advantage,\\n and make their own strengths look\\n like weaknesses. If they won the armistice,\\n they'd be able to retrench and\\n rearm, and the war would break out\\n again within a few years.\\n\\n\\n Now\\u2014at this point in time\\u2014they\\n could be beaten. They could be forced\\n to allow supervision of the production\\n potential, forced to disarm, rendered\\n impotent. But if the armistice went to\\n their own advantage ...\\n\\n\\n Already, they had taken the offensive\\n in the matter of the peace talks.\\n They had sent a full delegation to\\n Saarkkad V, the next planet out from\\n the Saarkkad sun, a chilly world inhabited\\n only by low-intelligence animals.\\n The Karna considered this to be\\n fully neutral territory, and Earth\\n couldn't argue the point very well. In\\n addition, they demanded that the conference\\n begin in three days, Terrestrial\\n time.\\n\\n\\n The trouble was that interstellar\\n communication beams travel a devil\\n of a lot faster than ships. It would\\n take more than a week for the Earth\\n government to get a vessel to Saarkkad\\n V. Earth had been caught unprepared\\n for an armistice. They\\n objected.\\n\\n\\n The Karna pointed out that the\\n Saarkkad sun was just as far from\\n Karn as it was from Earth, that it\\n was only a few million miles from a\\n planet which was allied with Earth,\\n and that it was unfair for Earth to\\n take so much time in preparing for an\\n armistice. Why hadn't Earth been prepared?\\n Did they intend to fight to the\\n utter destruction of Karn?\\n\\n\\n It wouldn't have been a problem at\\n all if Earth and Karn had fostered the\\n only two intelligent races in the galaxy.\\n The sort of grandstanding the\\n Karna were putting on had to be\\n played to an audience. But there were\\n other intelligent races throughout the\\n galaxy, most of whom had remained\\n as neutral as possible during the\\n Earth-Karn war. They had no intention\\n of sticking their figurative noses\\n into a battle between the two most\\n powerful races in the galaxy.\\n\\n\\n But whoever won the armistice\\n would find that some of the now-neutral\\n races would come in on their\\n side if war broke out again. If the\\n Karna played their cards right, their\\n side would be strong enough next\\n time to win.\\n\\n\\n So Earth had to get a delegation to\\n meet with the Karna representatives\\n within the three-day limit or lose what\\n might be a vital point in the negotiations.\\n\\n\\n And that was where Bertrand Malloy\\n came in.\\n\\n\\n He had been appointed Minister\\n and Plenipotentiary Extraordinary to\\n the Earth-Karn peace conference.\\n\\n\\n He looked up at the ceiling again.\\n \\\"What\\ncan\\nI do?\\\" he said softly.\\nOn the second day after the arrival\\n of the communique, Malloy\\n made his decision. He flipped on his\\n intercom and said: \\\"Miss Drayson,\\n get hold of James Nordon and Kylen\\n Braynek. I want to see them both immediately.\\n Send Nordon in first, and\\n tell Braynek to wait.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes, sir.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"And keep the recorder on. You\\n can file the tape later.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes, sir.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Malloy knew the woman would\\n listen in on the intercom anyway, and\\n it was better to give her permission to\\n do so.\\n\\n\\n James Nordon was tall, broad-shouldered,\\n and thirty-eight. His hair\\n was graying at the temples, and his\\n handsome face looked cool and efficient.\\n\\n\\n Malloy waved him to a seat.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Nordon, I have a job for you. It's\\n probably one of the most important\\n jobs you'll ever have in your life. It\\n can mean big things for you\\u2014promotion\\n and prestige if you do it well.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Nordon nodded slowly. \\\"Yes, sir.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Malloy explained the problem of\\n the Karna peace talks.\\n\\n\\n \\\"We need a man who can outthink\\n them,\\\" Malloy finished, \\\"and judging\\n from your record, I think you're that\\n man. It involves risk, of course. If\\n you make the wrong decisions, your\\n name will be mud back on Earth. But\\n I don't think there's much chance of\\n that, really. Do you want to handle\\n small-time operations all your life?\\n Of course not.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You'll be leaving within an hour\\n for Saarkkad V.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Nordon nodded again. \\\"Yes, sir;\\n certainly. Am I to go alone?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"No,\\\" said Malloy, \\\"I'm sending\\n an assistant with you\\u2014a man named\\n Kylen Braynek. Ever heard of him?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Nordon shook his head. \\\"Not that\\n I recall, Mr. Malloy. Should I have?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Not necessarily. He's a pretty\\n shrewd operator, though. He knows a\\n lot about interstellar law, and he's\\n capable of spotting a trap a mile away.\\n You'll be in charge, of course, but I\\n want you to pay special attention to\\n his advice.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I will, sir,\\\" Nordon said gratefully.\\n \\\"A man like that can be useful.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Right. Now, you go into the anteroom\\n over there. I've prepared a summary\\n of the situation, and you'll have\\n to study it and get it into your head\\n before the ship leaves. That isn't\\n much time, but it's the Karna who are\\n doing the pushing, not us.\\\"\\n\\n\\n As soon as Nordon had left, Malloy\\n said softly: \\\"Send in Braynek,\\n Miss Drayson.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Kylen Braynek was a smallish man\\n with mouse-brown hair that lay flat\\n against his skull, and hard, penetrating,\\n dark eyes that were shadowed by\\n heavy, protruding brows. Malloy asked\\n him to sit down.\\n\\n\\n Again Malloy went through the explanation\\n of the peace conference.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Naturally, they'll be trying to\\n trick you every step of the way,\\\" Malloy\\n went on. \\\"They're shrewd and\\n underhanded; we'll simply have to\\n be more shrewd and more underhanded.\\n Nordon's job is to sit\\n quietly and evaluate the data; yours\\n will be to find the loopholes they're\\n laying out for themselves and plug\\n them. Don't antagonize them, but\\n don't baby them, either. If you see\\n anything underhanded going on, let\\n Nordon know immediately.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"They won't get anything by me,\\n Mr. Malloy.\\\"\\nBy the time the ship from Earth\\n got there, the peace conference had\\n been going on for four days. Bertrand\\n Malloy had full reports on the whole\\n parley, as relayed to him through the\\n ship that had taken Nordon and Braynek\\n to Saarkkad V.\\n\\n\\n Secretary of State Blendwell stopped\\n off at Saarkkad IV before going\\n on to V to take charge of the conference.\\n He was a tallish, lean man with\\n a few strands of gray hair on the top\\n of his otherwise bald scalp, and he\\n wore a hearty, professional smile that\\n didn't quite make it to his calculating\\n eyes.\\n\\n\\n He took Malloy's hand and shook\\n it warmly. \\\"How are you, Mr. Ambassador?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Fine, Mr. Secretary. How's everything\\n on Earth?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Tense. They're waiting to see\\n what is going to happen on Five. So\\n am I, for that matter.\\\" His eyes were\\n curious. \\\"You decided not to go\\n yourself, eh?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I thought it better not to. I sent a\\n good team, instead. Would you like\\n to see the reports?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I certainly would.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Malloy handed them to the secretary,\\n and as he read, Malloy watched\\n him. Blendwell was a political appointee\\u2014a\\n good man, Malloy had to\\n admit, but he didn't know all the\\n ins and outs of the Diplomatic Corps.\\n\\n\\n When Blendwell looked up from\\n the reports at last, he said: \\\"Amazing!\\n They've held off the Karna at\\n every point! They've beaten them\\n back! They've managed to cope with\\n and outdo the finest team of negotiators\\n the Karna could send.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I thought they would,\\\" said Malloy,\\n trying to appear modest.\\n\\n\\n The secretary's eyes narrowed.\\n \\\"I've heard of the work you've been\\n doing here with ... ah ... sick men.\\n Is this one of your ... ah ... successes?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Malloy nodded. \\\"I think so. The\\n Karna put us in a dilemma, so I\\n threw a dilemma right back at them.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"How do you mean?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Nordon had a mental block\\n against making decisions. If he took\\n a girl out on a date, he'd have trouble\\n making up his mind whether to kiss\\n her or not until she made up his mind\\n for him, one way or the other. He's\\n that kind of guy. Until he's presented\\n with one, single, clear decision which\\n admits of no alternatives, he can't\\n move at all.\\n\\n\\n \\\"As you can see, the Karna tried\\n to give us several choices on each\\n point, and they were all rigged.
