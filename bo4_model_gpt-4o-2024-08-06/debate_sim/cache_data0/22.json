But not for some men and most boys!\\nI've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me\\u2014and a\\n girl besides\\u2014she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship\\n jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves\\n husbands in the one place they're still to be had\\u2014the planet\\n Venus\\u2014and you know I'll be in trouble.\\n\\n\\n Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.\\n\\n\\n Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled\\n out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\\\" Sis called after me as she opened a\\n book called\\nFamily Problems of the Frontier Woman\\n. \\\"Remember you're\\n a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in\\n front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their\\n hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's\\n crews are men; women are too busy with important things like government\\n to run ships. I felt free all over\\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to\\n really see the\\nEleanor Roosevelt\\n!\\nIt was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and\\n behind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out\\n of sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white\\n doors\\u2014on and on and on.\\nGee\\n, I thought excitedly, this is\\none big\\n ship\\n!\\n\\n\\n Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of\\n stars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing\\n that gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in\\nThe Boy\\n Rocketeers\\n, no portholes, no visiplates, nothing.\\n\\n\\n So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned\\n left. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading\\n inward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix\\n going\\npurr-purr-purrty-purr\\nin the comforting way big machinery has\\n when it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the\\n way to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were\\n portholes on the hull.\\n\\n\\n I'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we'd lifted, on\\n the transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the\\n ceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like\\n the dining salon and the library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in\\n case of emergency. I looked for the\\nimportant\\nthings.\\n\\n\\n As I trotted along the crossway, I sort of wished that Sis hadn't\\n decided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now,\\n I'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity\\n underfoot all the time just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf\\n of Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy can only make\\n faces and do what they say, same as the men have to do.\\n\\n\\n Still, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the\\n wall and see the sliding panels that could come charging out and block\\n the crossway into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed\\n into the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits\\n standing in them, like those knights they used to have back in the\\n Middle Ages.\\n\\n\\n \\\"In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of\\n companionway,\\\" they had the words etched into the glass, \\\"break glass\\n with hammer upon wall, remove spacesuit and proceed to don it in the\\n following fashion.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I read the \\\"following fashion\\\" until I knew it by heart.\\nBoy\\n, I said\\n to myself,\\nI hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get\\n into one of those! Bet it would be more fun than those diving suits\\n back in Undersea!\\nAnd all the time I was alone. That was the best part.\\nThen I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. \\\"Notice! Passengers\\n not permitted past this point!\\\" A big sign in red.\\n\\n\\n I peeked around the corner. I knew it\\u2014the next deck was the hull. I\\n could see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the\\n velvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed\\n existed in the Universe.\\n\\n\\n There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this\\n distance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely.\\n If I just took one quick look....\\n\\n\\n But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.\\n Then I saw the big red sign again. \\\"Passengers not permitted\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth\\n Citizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And\\n didn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to\\n get an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the\\n careful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to\\n men.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You\\n can't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth\\n Passport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this\\n clause\\u2014'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,\\n this number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations\\n pertaining'\\u2014and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that\\n you will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.\\n No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb\\n things. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what\\nWomen\\nlike and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting\\n married. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her\\n wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.\\n\\n\\n Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do\\n with me. I knew what Sis could say to\\nthat\\n, but at least it was an\\n argument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.\\n\\n\\n I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to\\n the left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the\\n movies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding\\n off the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it\\n must be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose\\n against the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,\\n Marsbound. I wished I was on that one!\\n\\n\\n Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of\\n blank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the\\n wall in glowing red letters were the words, \\\"Lifeboat 47. Passengers:\\n Thirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!\\\"\\n\\n\\n Another one of those signs.\\nI crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out\\n the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked\\n under the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get\\n into it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I\\n knew must be the door. But I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open\\n it with. Not even a button you could press.\\n\\n\\n That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps\\n back home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock\\n combinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice\\n key\\u2014might as well see if that's it, I figured.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\\\"\\n\\n\\n For a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million\\n possible combinations\\u2014The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and\\n a hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed\\n around my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine.\\n\\n\\n I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and\\n sat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found\\n myself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the\\n cold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen.\\nHe was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that\\n looked hard and soft at the same time.\\n\\n\\n His boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his\\n back.\\n\\n\\n And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the\\n deep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards\\n in New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation\\u2014the kind of tan\\n that comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His\\n hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long\\n combed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down\\n to his shoulders.\\n\\n\\n I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books;\\n every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable\\n soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the\\n blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all,\\n when I suddenly got scared right through.\\n\\n\\n His eyes.\\n\\n\\n They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them.\\n Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did\\n it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a\\n surface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it\\n opened two long tooth-studded jaws.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Green shatas!\\\" he said suddenly. \\\"Only a tadpole. I must be getting\\n jumpy enough to splash.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly\\n leather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted\\n to my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes.\\n\\n\\n I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. \\\"My name is Ferdinand\\n Sparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.\\u2014Mr.\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Hope for your sake,\\\" he said to me, \\\"that you aren't what you\\n seem\\u2014tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nWhat?\\n\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come\\n from Flatfolk ways.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they? Are you a Venusian?\\n What part of Venus do you come from? Why did you say you hope\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n He chuckled and swung me up into one of the bunks that lined the\\n lifeboat. \\\"Questions you ask,\\\" he said in his soft voice. \\\"Venus is a\\n sharp enough place for a dryhorn, let alone a tadpole dryhorn with a\\n boss-minded sister.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'm not a dryleg,\\\" I told him proudly. \\\"\\nWe're\\nfrom Undersea.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nDryhorn\\n, I said, not dryleg. And what's Undersea?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just\\n like on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns.\\\" And then I told him\\n how Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when\\n the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers\\n figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms.\\nHe nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were\\n bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just\\n about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.\\n\\n\\n He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the\\n first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I\\n told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood\\n listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked\\n disgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World\\n Council, had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after\\n the Third Atomic War had resulted in the Maternal Revolution.\\nHe almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown\\n up in a surfacing boat.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we\\n might as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth,\\n she figured. You know, the three-out-of-four.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"How's that?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on\\n Earth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way\\n back in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with\\n the wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die\\n or get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the\\n planets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal\\n husband, he's not much to boast about.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The stranger nodded violently. \\\"Not on Earth, he isn't. Those busybody\\n anura make sure of that. What a place! Suffering gridniks, I had a\\n bellyful!\\\"\\n\\n\\n He told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been\\n able to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little\\n islands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a\\n surplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive\\n planet, he didn't know \\\"it's a woman's world,\\\" like the older boys in\\n school used to say.\\n\\n\\n The moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble. He didn't know he had\\n to register at a government-operated hotel for transient males; he\\n threw a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something\\n nasty about the length of his hair; and\\nimagine\\n!\\u2014he not only\\n resisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he\\n sassed the judge in open court!\\n\\n\\n \\\"Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female\\n attorneys. Told\\nher\\nthat where\\nI\\ncame from, a man spoke his piece\\n when he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"What happened?\\\" I asked breathlessly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up brinosaur took\\n my last munit for fines, then explained that she was remitting the\\n rest because I was a foreigner and uneducated.\\\" His eyes grew dark for\\n a moment. He chuckled again. \\\"But I wasn't going to serve all those\\n fancy little prison sentences. Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination,\\n they call it? Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken\\n mother world from my feet forever. The women on it deserve their men.\\n My pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking\\n for me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit. So I stowed away.\\\"\\nFor a moment, I didn't understand him. When I did, I was almost ill.\\n \\\"Y-you mean,\\\" I choked, \\\"th-that you're b-breaking the law right now?\\n And I'm with you while you're doing it?\\\"\\n\\n\\n He leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously.\\n \\\"What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days? Besides, what\\n business do\\nyou\\nhave this close to the hull?\\\"\\n\\n\\n After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. \\\"You're right. I've also\\n become a male outside the law. We're in this together.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found\\n myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis\\n insists such things have always had for men.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll\\n call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I liked the sound of Ford. \\\"Is Butt a nickname, too?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a\\n blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the\\n eighties\\u2014the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named\\n all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the\\n name they were saving for a girl.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?\\\"\\n\\n\\n He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. \\\"Oh, a nestful. Of course, they\\n were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys\\u2014all\\n except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.\\n Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down\\n the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of\\n the blaster above the firing button. \\\"Have you killed a lot of men with\\n that, Mr. Butt?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford.\\\" He frowned and sighted at\\n the light globe. \\\"No more'n twelve\\u2014not counting five government\\n paddlefeet, of course. I'm a peaceable planter. Way I figure it,\\n violence never accomplishes much that's important. My brother Sas,\\n now\\u2014\\\"\\nHe had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother\\n when the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a\\n growing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very\\n off-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh\\n fruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat\\n and Butt was used to a farmer's diet.\\n\\n\\n Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have\\n been pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way\\n to handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things\\n like seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell.\\n Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering\\n and I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things\\n about Venus every time I visited that stowaway....\\n\\n\\n I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the\\n native Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference\\n between a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the\\n slaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging,\\n Butt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it\\n so carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from\\n the tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no\\n matter what, he would never let me hold it.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Sorry, Ford, old tad,\\\" he would drawl, spinning around and around in\\n the control swivel-chair at the nose of the lifeboat. \\\"But way I look\\n at it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like the\\n giant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found. When you've grown\\n enough so's your pop feels you ought to have a weapon, why, then's the\\n time to learn it and you might's well learn fast. Before then, you're\\n plain too young to be even near it.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age. I don't even\\n have an older brother as head of my family like your brother Labrador.\\n All I have is Sis. And\\nshe\\n\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"She'll marry some fancy dryhorn who's never been farther South than\\n the Polar Coast.

She ever....\\\"\\n\\n\\n And he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn. I sat in the\\n swivel chair he'd vacated and tried to answer his questions. But there\\n was a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, for\\n instance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out. Yes, I'd\\n tell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than\\n the average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming to\\n speak of, back in Undersea, but\\u2014yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about as\\n much as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure\\n pump regulation.\\n\\n\\n How would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me?\\nSis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture. Most of the\\n other girls who were going to Venus for husbands talked to each other\\n during the lecture, but not\\nmy\\nsister! She hung on every word, took\\n notes even, and asked enough questions to make the perspiring purser\\n really work in those orientation periods.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I am very sorry, Miss Sparling,\\\" he said with pretty heavy sarcasm,\\n \\\"but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Macro\\n Continent. Since the human population is well below one per thousand\\n square miles, it can readily be understood that the quantity of\\n tilled soil, land or sub-surface, is so small that\\u2014Wait, I remember\\n something. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not exactly an\\n edible one. The wild\\ndunging\\ndrug is harvested there by criminal\\n speculators. Contrary to belief on Earth, the traffic has been growing\\n in recent years. In fact\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Pardon me, sir,\\\" I broke in, \\\"but doesn't\\ndunging\\ncome only from\\n Leif Erickson Island off the Moscow Peninsula of the Macro Continent?\\n You remember, purser\\u2014Wang Li's third exploration, where he proved the\\n island and the peninsula didn't meet for most of the year?\\\"\\n\\n\\n The purser nodded slowly. \\\"I forgot,\\\" he admitted. \\\"Sorry, ladies, but\\n the boy's right. Please make the correction in your notes.\\\"\\n\\n\\n But Sis was the only one who took notes, and she didn't take that one.\\n She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while\\n I got sicker and sicker. Then she shut her pad with the final gesture\\n of the right hand that Mom used to use just before challenging the\\n opposition to come right down on the Council floor and debate it out\\n with her.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ferdinand,\\\" Sis said, \\\"let's go back to our cabin.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was\\n in for it. \\\"I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's\\n library,\\\" I told her in a hurry.\\n\\n\\n \\\"No doubt,\\\" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. \\\"But\\n you aren't going to tell me that you read about\\ndunging\\nin the ship's\\n library. The books there have been censored by a government agent of\\n Earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible\\n young male minds like yours. She would not have allowed\\u2014this Terran\\n Agent\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Paddlefoot,\\\" I sneered.\\n\\n\\n Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. \\\"Now that's a term,\\\" she said\\n carefully, \\\"that is used only by Venusian riffraff.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"They're not!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Not what?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Riffraff,\\\" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the\\n time and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away!\\n \\\"They're trappers and farmers, pioneers and explorers, who're building\\n Venus. And it takes a real man to build on a hot, hungry hell like\\n Venus.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Does it, now?\\\" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow\\n a second pair of ears. \\\"Tell me more.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you start\\n civilization on a new planet. You've got to have men who aren't afraid\\n to make their own law if necessary\\u2014with their own guns. That's where\\n law begins; the books get written up later.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You're going to\\ntell\\n, Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is\\n speaking through your mouth!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Nobody!\\\" I insisted. \\\"They're my own ideas!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"They are remarkably well-organized for a young boy's ideas. A boy\\n who, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless\\n entirely masculine boredom with political philosophy. I plan to have a\\n government career on that new planet you talk about, Ferdinand\\u2014after\\n I have found a good, steady husband, of course\\u2014and I don't look\\n forward to a masculinist radical in the family. Now, who has been\\n filling your head with all this nonsense?\\\"\\nI was sweating. Sis has that deadly bulldog approach when she feels\\n someone is lying. I pulled my pulpast handkerchief from my pocket to\\n wipe my face. Something rattled to the floor.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?\\\"\\n\\n\\n A trap seemed to be hinging noisily into place. \\\"One of the passengers\\n wanted to see how you looked in a bathing suit.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"The passengers on this ship are all female. I can't imagine any of\\n them that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has\\n been giving you these anti-social ideas, isn't it? A war-mongering\\n masculinist like all the frustrated men who want to engage in\\n government and don't have the vaguest idea how to. Except, of course,\\n in their ancient, bloody ways. Ferdinand, who has been perverting that\\n sunny and carefree soul of yours?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Nobody!\\nNobody!\\n\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ferdinand, there's no point in lying! I demand\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I told you, Sis. I told you! And don't call me Ferdinand. Call me\\n Ford.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ford?\\nFord?\\nNow, you listen to me, Ferdinand....\\\"\\n\\n\\n After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few\\n moments. I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided\\n miserably. Besides, she was a girl.\\n\\n\\n All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could\\n help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to\\n him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a\\n little better.\\n\\n\\n The door opened on the signal, \\\"Sesame.\\\" When Butt saw somebody was\\n with me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his\\n fingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.\\n\\n\\n He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered\\n his blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump\\n when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.\\n\\n\\n \\\"An honor, Miss Sparling,\\\" he said in that rumbly voice. \\\"Please come\\n right in. There's a hurry-up draft.\\\"\\n\\n\\n So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the\\n door. I tried to catch his eye so I could give him some kind of hint or\\n explanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in\\n the control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say\\n that for her. She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed\\n sternly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"First, Mr. Brown,\\\" she began, like talking to a cluck of a kid in\\n class, \\\"you realize that you are not only committing the political\\n crime of traveling without a visa, and the criminal one of stowing away\\n without paying your fare, but the moral delinquency of consuming stores\\n intended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency?\\\"\\nHe opened his mouth to its maximum width and raised an enormous hand.\\n Then he let the air out and dropped his arm.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I take it you either have no defense or care to make none,\\\" Sis added\\n caustically.\\n\\n\\n Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.\\n \\\"Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And\\nyou\\nwant to foul up\\n Venus.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"We haven't done so badly on Earth, after the mess you men made of\\n politics. It needed a revolution of the mothers before\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Needed nothing. Everyone wanted peace. Earth is a weary old world.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee\\n Brown.\\\" Hearing his rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over\\n her. Sis said with a certain amount of hurry and change of tone, \\\"What\\ndo\\nyou have to say about stowing away and using up lifeboat stores?\\\"\\nHe cocked his head and considered a moment. \\\"Look,\\\" he said finally,\\n \\\"I have more than enough munit to pay for round trip tickets, but I\\n couldn't get a return visa because of that brinosaur judge and all\\n the charges she hung on me. Had to stow away. Picked the\\nEleanor\\n Roosevelt\\nbecause a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mine\\n and they were willing to help. But this lifeboat\\u2014don't you know that\\n every passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs?\\n Not to mention the food I didn't eat because it stuck in my throat?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes,\\\" she said bitterly. \\\"You had this boy steal fresh fruit for you.\\n I suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes him\\n equally guilty?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"No, Sis, he didn't,\\\" I was beginning to argue. \\\"All he wanted\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Sure I knew. Also know that if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll be\\n sent back to Earth to serve out those fancy little sentences.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, you're guilty of them, aren't you?\\\"\\n\\n\\n He waved his hands at her impatiently. \\\"I'm not talking law, female;\\n I'm talking sense.

But not for some men and most boys!\\nI've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me\\u2014and a\\n girl besides\\u2014she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship\\n jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves\\n husbands in the one place they're still to be had\\u2014the planet\\n Venus\\u2014and you know I'll be in trouble.\\n\\n\\n Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.\\n\\n\\n Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled\\n out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\\\" Sis called after me as she opened a\\n book called\\nFamily Problems of the Frontier Woman\\n. \\\"Remember you're\\n a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in\\n front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their\\n hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's\\n crews are men; women are too busy with important things like government\\n to run ships. I felt free all over\\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to\\n really see the\\nEleanor Roosevelt\\n!\\nIt was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and\\n behind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out\\n of sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white\\n doors\\u2014on and on and on.\\nGee\\n, I thought excitedly, this is\\none big\\n ship\\n!\\n\\n\\n Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of\\n stars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing\\n that gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in\\nThe Boy\\n Rocketeers\\n, no portholes, no visiplates, nothing.\\n\\n\\n So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned\\n left. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading\\n inward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix\\n going\\npurr-purr-purrty-purr\\nin the comforting way big machinery has\\n when it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the\\n way to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were\\n portholes on the hull.\\n\\n\\n I'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we'd lifted, on\\n the transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the\\n ceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like\\n the dining salon and the library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in\\n case of emergency. I looked for the\\nimportant\\nthings.\\n\\n\\n As I trotted along the crossway, I sort of wished that Sis hadn't\\n decided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now,\\n I'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity\\n underfoot all the time just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf\\n of Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy can only make\\n faces and do what they say, same as the men have to do.\\n\\n\\n Still, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the\\n wall and see the sliding panels that could come charging out and block\\n the crossway into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed\\n into the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits\\n standing in them, like those knights they used to have back in the\\n Middle Ages.\\n\\n\\n \\\"In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of\\n companionway,\\\" they had the words etched into the glass, \\\"break glass\\n with hammer upon wall, remove spacesuit and proceed to don it in the\\n following fashion.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I read the \\\"following fashion\\\" until I knew it by heart.\\nBoy\\n, I said\\n to myself,\\nI hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get\\n into one of those! Bet it would be more fun than those diving suits\\n back in Undersea!\\nAnd all the time I was alone. That was the best part.\\nThen I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. \\\"Notice! Passengers\\n not permitted past this point!\\\" A big sign in red.\\n\\n\\n I peeked around the corner. I knew it\\u2014the next deck was the hull. I\\n could see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the\\n velvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed\\n existed in the Universe.\\n\\n\\n There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this\\n distance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely.\\n If I just took one quick look....\\n\\n\\n But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.\\n Then I saw the big red sign again. \\\"Passengers not permitted\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth\\n Citizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And\\n didn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to\\n get an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the\\n careful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to\\n men.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You\\n can't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth\\n Passport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this\\n clause\\u2014'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,\\n this number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations\\n pertaining'\\u2014and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that\\n you will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.\\n No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb\\n things. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what\\nWomen\\nlike and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting\\n married. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her\\n wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.\\n\\n\\n Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do\\n with me. I knew what Sis could say to\\nthat\\n, but at least it was an\\n argument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.\\n\\n\\n I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to\\n the left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the\\n movies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding\\n off the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it\\n must be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose\\n against the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,\\n Marsbound. I wished I was on that one!\\n\\n\\n Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of\\n blank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the\\n wall in glowing red letters were the words, \\\"Lifeboat 47. Passengers:\\n Thirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!\\\"\\n\\n\\n Another one of those signs.\\nI crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out\\n the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked\\n under the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get\\n into it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I\\n knew must be the door. But I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open\\n it with. Not even a button you could press.\\n\\n\\n That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps\\n back home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock\\n combinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice\\n key\\u2014might as well see if that's it, I figured.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\\\"\\n\\n\\n For a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million\\n possible combinations\\u2014The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and\\n a hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed\\n around my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine.\\n\\n\\n I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and\\n sat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found\\n myself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the\\n cold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen.\\nHe was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that\\n looked hard and soft at the same time.\\n\\n\\n His boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his\\n back.\\n\\n\\n And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the\\n deep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards\\n in New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation\\u2014the kind of tan\\n that comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His\\n hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long\\n combed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down\\n to his shoulders.\\n\\n\\n I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books;\\n every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable\\n soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the\\n blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all,\\n when I suddenly got scared right through.\\n\\n\\n His eyes.\\n\\n\\n They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them.\\n Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did\\n it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a\\n surface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it\\n opened two long tooth-studded jaws.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Green shatas!\\\" he said suddenly. \\\"Only a tadpole. I must be getting\\n jumpy enough to splash.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly\\n leather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted\\n to my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes.\\n\\n\\n I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. \\\"My name is Ferdinand\\n Sparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.\\u2014Mr.\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Hope for your sake,\\\" he said to me, \\\"that you aren't what you\\n seem\\u2014tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nWhat?\\n\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come\\n from Flatfolk ways.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they? Are you a Venusian?\\n What part of Venus do you come from? Why did you say you hope\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n He chuckled and swung me up into one of the bunks that lined the\\n lifeboat. \\\"Questions you ask,\\\" he said in his soft voice. \\\"Venus is a\\n sharp enough place for a dryhorn, let alone a tadpole dryhorn with a\\n boss-minded sister.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'm not a dryleg,\\\" I told him proudly. \\\"\\nWe're\\nfrom Undersea.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nDryhorn\\n, I said, not dryleg. And what's Undersea?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just\\n like on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns.\\\" And then I told him\\n how Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when\\n the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers\\n figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms.\\nHe nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were\\n bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just\\n about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.\\n\\n\\n He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the\\n first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I\\n told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood\\n listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked\\n disgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World\\n Council, had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after\\n the Third Atomic War had resulted in the Maternal Revolution.\\nHe almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown\\n up in a surfacing boat.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we\\n might as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth,\\n she figured. You know, the three-out-of-four.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"How's that?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on\\n Earth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way\\n back in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with\\n the wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die\\n or get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the\\n planets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal\\n husband, he's not much to boast about.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The stranger nodded violently. \\\"Not on Earth, he isn't. Those busybody\\n anura make sure of that. What a place! Suffering gridniks, I had a\\n bellyful!\\\"\\n\\n\\n He told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been\\n able to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little\\n islands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a\\n surplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive\\n planet, he didn't know \\\"it's a woman's world,\\\" like the older boys in\\n school used to say.\\n\\n\\n The moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble. He didn't know he had\\n to register at a government-operated hotel for transient males; he\\n threw a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something\\n nasty about the length of his hair; and\\nimagine\\n!\\u2014he not only\\n resisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he\\n sassed the judge in open court!\\n\\n\\n \\\"Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female\\n attorneys. Told\\nher\\nthat where\\nI\\ncame from, a man spoke his piece\\n when he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"What happened?\\\" I asked breathlessly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up brinosaur took\\n my last munit for fines, then explained that she was remitting the\\n rest because I was a foreigner and uneducated.\\\" His eyes grew dark for\\n a moment. He chuckled again. \\\"But I wasn't going to serve all those\\n fancy little prison sentences. Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination,\\n they call it? Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken\\n mother world from my feet forever. The women on it deserve their men.\\n My pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking\\n for me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit. So I stowed away.\\\"\\nFor a moment, I didn't understand him. When I did, I was almost ill.\\n \\\"Y-you mean,\\\" I choked, \\\"th-that you're b-breaking the law right now?\\n And I'm with you while you're doing it?\\\"\\n\\n\\n He leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously.\\n \\\"What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days? Besides, what\\n business do\\nyou\\nhave this close to the hull?\\\"\\n\\n\\n After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. \\\"You're right. I've also\\n become a male outside the law. We're in this together.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found\\n myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis\\n insists such things have always had for men.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll\\n call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I liked the sound of Ford. \\\"Is Butt a nickname, too?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a\\n blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the\\n eighties\\u2014the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named\\n all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the\\n name they were saving for a girl.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?\\\"\\n\\n\\n He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. \\\"Oh, a nestful. Of course, they\\n were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys\\u2014all\\n except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.\\n Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down\\n the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of\\n the blaster above the firing button. \\\"Have you killed a lot of men with\\n that, Mr. Butt?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford.\\\" He frowned and sighted at\\n the light globe. \\\"No more'n twelve\\u2014not counting five government\\n paddlefeet, of course. I'm a peaceable planter. Way I figure it,\\n violence never accomplishes much that's important. My brother Sas,\\n now\\u2014\\\"\\nHe had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother\\n when the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a\\n growing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very\\n off-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh\\n fruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat\\n and Butt was used to a farmer's diet.\\n\\n\\n Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have\\n been pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way\\n to handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things\\n like seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell.\\n Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering\\n and I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things\\n about Venus every time I visited that stowaway....\\n\\n\\n I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the\\n native Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference\\n between a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the\\n slaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging,\\n Butt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it\\n so carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from\\n the tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no\\n matter what, he would never let me hold it.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Sorry, Ford, old tad,\\\" he would drawl, spinning around and around in\\n the control swivel-chair at the nose of the lifeboat. \\\"But way I look\\n at it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like the\\n giant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found. When you've grown\\n enough so's your pop feels you ought to have a weapon, why, then's the\\n time to learn it and you might's well learn fast. Before then, you're\\n plain too young to be even near it.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age. I don't even\\n have an older brother as head of my family like your brother Labrador.\\n All I have is Sis. And\\nshe\\n\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"She'll marry some fancy dryhorn who's never been farther South than\\n the Polar Coast. And she'll stay head of the family, if I know her\\n breed of green shata.\\nBossy, opinionated.\\nBy the way, Fordie,\\\" he\\n said, rising and stretching so the fish-leather bounced and rippled off\\n his biceps, \\\"that sister. She ever....\\\"\\n\\n\\n And he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn. I sat in the\\n swivel chair he'd vacated and tried to answer his questions. But there\\n was a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, for\\n instance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out. Yes, I'd\\n tell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than\\n the average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming to\\n speak of, back in Undersea, but\\u2014yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about as\\n much as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure\\n pump regulation.\\n\\n\\n How would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me?\\nSis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture. Most of the\\n other girls who were going to Venus for husbands talked to each other\\n during the lecture, but not\\nmy\\nsister! She hung on every word, took\\n notes even, and asked enough questions to make the perspiring purser\\n really work in those orientation periods.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I am very sorry, Miss Sparling,\\\" he said with pretty heavy sarcasm,\\n \\\"but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Macro\\n Continent. Since the human population is well below one per thousand\\n square miles, it can readily be understood that the quantity of\\n tilled soil, land or sub-surface, is so small that\\u2014Wait, I remember\\n something. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not exactly an\\n edible one. The wild\\ndunging\\ndrug is harvested there by criminal\\n speculators. Contrary to belief on Earth, the traffic has been growing\\n in recent years. In fact\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Pardon me, sir,\\\" I broke in, \\\"but doesn't\\ndunging\\ncome only from\\n Leif Erickson Island off the Moscow Peninsula of the Macro Continent?\\n You remember, purser\\u2014Wang Li's third exploration, where he proved the\\n island and the peninsula didn't meet for most of the year?\\\"\\n\\n\\n The purser nodded slowly. \\\"I forgot,\\\" he admitted. \\\"Sorry, ladies, but\\n the boy's right. Please make the correction in your notes.\\\"\\n\\n\\n But Sis was the only one who took notes, and she didn't take that one.\\n She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while\\n I got sicker and sicker. Then she shut her pad with the final gesture\\n of the right hand that Mom used to use just before challenging the\\n opposition to come right down on the Council floor and debate it out\\n with her.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ferdinand,\\\" Sis said, \\\"let's go back to our cabin.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was\\n in for it. \\\"I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's\\n library,\\\" I told her in a hurry.\\n\\n\\n \\\"No doubt,\\\" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. \\\"But\\n you aren't going to tell me that you read about\\ndunging\\nin the ship's\\n library. The books there have been censored by a government agent of\\n Earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible\\n young male minds like yours. She would not have allowed\\u2014this Terran\\n Agent\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Paddlefoot,\\\" I sneered.\\n\\n\\n Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. \\\"Now that's a term,\\\" she said\\n carefully, \\\"that is used only by Venusian riffraff.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"They're not!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Not what?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Riffraff,\\\" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the\\n time and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away!\\n \\\"They're trappers and farmers, pioneers and explorers, who're building\\n Venus. And it takes a real man to build on a hot, hungry hell like\\n Venus.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Does it, now?\\\" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow\\n a second pair of ears. \\\"Tell me more.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you start\\n civilization on a new planet. You've got to have men who aren't afraid\\n to make their own law if necessary\\u2014with their own guns. That's where\\n law begins; the books get written up later.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You're going to\\ntell\\n, Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is\\n speaking through your mouth!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Nobody!\\\" I insisted. \\\"They're my own ideas!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"They are remarkably well-organized for a young boy's ideas. A boy\\n who, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless\\n entirely masculine boredom with political philosophy. I plan to have a\\n government career on that new planet you talk about, Ferdinand\\u2014after\\n I have found a good, steady husband, of course\\u2014and I don't look\\n forward to a masculinist radical in the family. Now, who has been\\n filling your head with all this nonsense?\\\"\\nI was sweating. Sis has that deadly bulldog approach when she feels\\n someone is lying. I pulled my pulpast handkerchief from my pocket to\\n wipe my face. Something rattled to the floor.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?\\\"\\n\\n\\n A trap seemed to be hinging noisily into place. \\\"One of the passengers\\n wanted to see how you looked in a bathing suit.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"The passengers on this ship are all female. I can't imagine any of\\n them that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has\\n been giving you these anti-social ideas, isn't it? A war-mongering\\n masculinist like all the frustrated men who want to engage in\\n government and don't have the vaguest idea how to. Except, of course,\\n in their ancient, bloody ways. Ferdinand, who has been perverting that\\n sunny and carefree soul of yours?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Nobody!\\nNobody!\\n\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ferdinand, there's no point in lying! I demand\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I told you, Sis. I told you! And don't call me Ferdinand. Call me\\n Ford.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ford?\\nFord?\\nNow, you listen to me, Ferdinand....\\\"\\n\\n\\n After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few\\n moments. I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided\\n miserably. Besides, she was a girl.\\n\\n\\n All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could\\n help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to\\n him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a\\n little better.\\n\\n\\n The door opened on the signal, \\\"Sesame.\\\" When Butt saw somebody was\\n with me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his\\n fingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.\\n\\n\\n He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered\\n his blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump\\n when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.\\n\\n\\n \\\"An honor, Miss Sparling,\\\" he said in that rumbly voice. \\\"Please come\\n right in. There's a hurry-up draft.\\\"\\n\\n\\n So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the\\n door.

But not for some men and most boys!\\nI've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me\\u2014and a\\n girl besides\\u2014she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship\\n jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves\\n husbands in the one place they're still to be had\\u2014the planet\\n Venus\\u2014and you know I'll be in trouble.\\n\\n\\n Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.\\n\\n\\n Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled\\n out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\\\" Sis called after me as she opened a\\n book called\\nFamily Problems of the Frontier Woman\\n. \\\"Remember you're\\n a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in\\n front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their\\n hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's\\n crews are men; women are too busy with important things like government\\n to run ships. I felt free all over\\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to\\n really see the\\nEleanor Roosevelt\\n!\\nIt was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and\\n behind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out\\n of sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white\\n doors\\u2014on and on and on.\\nGee\\n, I thought excitedly, this is\\none big\\n ship\\n!\\n\\n\\n Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of\\n stars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing\\n that gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in\\nThe Boy\\n Rocketeers\\n, no portholes, no visiplates, nothing.\\n\\n\\n So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned\\n left. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading\\n inward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix\\n going\\npurr-purr-purrty-purr\\nin the comforting way big machinery has\\n when it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the\\n way to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were\\n portholes on the hull.\\n\\n\\n I'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we'd lifted, on\\n the transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the\\n ceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like\\n the dining salon and the library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in\\n case of emergency. I looked for the\\nimportant\\nthings.\\n\\n\\n As I trotted along the crossway, I sort of wished that Sis hadn't\\n decided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now,\\n I'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity\\n underfoot all the time just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf\\n of Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy can only make\\n faces and do what they say, same as the men have to do.\\n\\n\\n Still, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the\\n wall and see the sliding panels that could come charging out and block\\n the crossway into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed\\n into the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits\\n standing in them, like those knights they used to have back in the\\n Middle Ages.\\n\\n\\n \\\"In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of\\n companionway,\\\" they had the words etched into the glass, \\\"break glass\\n with hammer upon wall, remove spacesuit and proceed to don it in the\\n following fashion.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I read the \\\"following fashion\\\" until I knew it by heart.\\nBoy\\n, I said\\n to myself,\\nI hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get\\n into one of those! Bet it would be more fun than those diving suits\\n back in Undersea!\\nAnd all the time I was alone. That was the best part.\\nThen I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. \\\"Notice! Passengers\\n not permitted past this point!\\\" A big sign in red.\\n\\n\\n I peeked around the corner. I knew it\\u2014the next deck was the hull. I\\n could see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the\\n velvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed\\n existed in the Universe.\\n\\n\\n There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this\\n distance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely.\\n If I just took one quick look....\\n\\n\\n But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.\\n Then I saw the big red sign again. \\\"Passengers not permitted\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth\\n Citizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And\\n didn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to\\n get an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the\\n careful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to\\n men.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You\\n can't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth\\n Passport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this\\n clause\\u2014'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,\\n this number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations\\n pertaining'\\u2014and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that\\n you will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.\\n No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb\\n things. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what\\nWomen\\nlike and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting\\n married. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her\\n wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.\\n\\n\\n Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do\\n with me. I knew what Sis could say to\\nthat\\n, but at least it was an\\n argument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.\\n\\n\\n I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to\\n the left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the\\n movies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding\\n off the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it\\n must be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose\\n against the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,\\n Marsbound. I wished I was on that one!\\n\\n\\n Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of\\n blank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the\\n wall in glowing red letters were the words, \\\"Lifeboat 47. Passengers:\\n Thirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!\\\"\\n\\n\\n Another one of those signs.\\nI crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out\\n the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked\\n under the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get\\n into it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I\\n knew must be the door. But I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open\\n it with. Not even a button you could press.\\n\\n\\n That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps\\n back home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock\\n combinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice\\n key\\u2014might as well see if that's it, I figured.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\\\"\\n\\n\\n For a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million\\n possible combinations\\u2014The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and\\n a hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed\\n around my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine.\\n\\n\\n I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and\\n sat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found\\n myself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the\\n cold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen.\\nHe was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that\\n looked hard and soft at the same time.\\n\\n\\n His boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his\\n back.\\n\\n\\n And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the\\n deep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards\\n in New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation\\u2014the kind of tan\\n that comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His\\n hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long\\n combed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down\\n to his shoulders.\\n\\n\\n I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books;\\n every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable\\n soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the\\n blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all,\\n when I suddenly got scared right through.\\n\\n\\n His eyes.\\n\\n\\n They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them.\\n Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did\\n it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a\\n surface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it\\n opened two long tooth-studded jaws.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Green shatas!\\\" he said suddenly. \\\"Only a tadpole. I must be getting\\n jumpy enough to splash.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly\\n leather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted\\n to my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes.\\n\\n\\n I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. \\\"My name is Ferdinand\\n Sparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.\\u2014Mr.\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Hope for your sake,\\\" he said to me, \\\"that you aren't what you\\n seem\\u2014tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nWhat?\\n\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come\\n from Flatfolk ways.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they? Are you a Venusian?\\n What part of Venus do you come from? Why did you say you hope\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n He chuckled and swung me up into one of the bunks that lined the\\n lifeboat. \\\"Questions you ask,\\\" he said in his soft voice. \\\"Venus is a\\n sharp enough place for a dryhorn, let alone a tadpole dryhorn with a\\n boss-minded sister.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'm not a dryleg,\\\" I told him proudly. \\\"\\nWe're\\nfrom Undersea.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nDryhorn\\n, I said, not dryleg. And what's Undersea?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just\\n like on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns.\\\" And then I told him\\n how Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when\\n the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers\\n figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms.\\nHe nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were\\n bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just\\n about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.\\n\\n\\n He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the\\n first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I\\n told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood\\n listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked\\n disgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World\\n Council, had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after\\n the Third Atomic War had resulted in the Maternal Revolution.\\nHe almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown\\n up in a surfacing boat.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we\\n might as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth,\\n she figured. You know, the three-out-of-four.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"How's that?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on\\n Earth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way\\n back in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with\\n the wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die\\n or get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the\\n planets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal\\n husband, he's not much to boast about.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The stranger nodded violently. \\\"Not on Earth, he isn't. Those busybody\\n anura make sure of that. What a place! Suffering gridniks, I had a\\n bellyful!\\\"\\n\\n\\n He told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been\\n able to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little\\n islands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a\\n surplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive\\n planet, he didn't know \\\"it's a woman's world,\\\" like the older boys in\\n school used to say.\\n\\n\\n The moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble. He didn't know he had\\n to register at a government-operated hotel for transient males; he\\n threw a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something\\n nasty about the length of his hair; and\\nimagine\\n!\\u2014he not only\\n resisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he\\n sassed the judge in open court!\\n\\n\\n \\\"Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female\\n attorneys. Told\\nher\\nthat where\\nI\\ncame from, a man spoke his piece\\n when he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"What happened?\\\" I asked breathlessly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up brinosaur took\\n my last munit for fines, then explained that she was remitting the\\n rest because I was a foreigner and uneducated.\\\" His eyes grew dark for\\n a moment. He chuckled again. \\\"But I wasn't going to serve all those\\n fancy little prison sentences. Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination,\\n they call it? Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken\\n mother world from my feet forever. The women on it deserve their men.\\n My pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking\\n for me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit. So I stowed away.\\\"\\nFor a moment, I didn't understand him. When I did, I was almost ill.\\n \\\"Y-you mean,\\\" I choked, \\\"th-that you're b-breaking the law right now?\\n And I'm with you while you're doing it?\\\"\\n\\n\\n He leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously.\\n \\\"What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days? Besides, what\\n business do\\nyou\\nhave this close to the hull?\\\"\\n\\n\\n After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. \\\"You're right. I've also\\n become a male outside the law. We're in this together.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found\\n myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis\\n insists such things have always had for men.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll\\n call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I liked the sound of Ford. \\\"Is Butt a nickname, too?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a\\n blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the\\n eighties\\u2014the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named\\n all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the\\n name they were saving for a girl.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?\\\"\\n\\n\\n He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. \\\"Oh, a nestful. Of course, they\\n were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys\\u2014all\\n except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.\\n Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down\\n the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of\\n the blaster above the firing button. \\\"Have you killed a lot of men with\\n that, Mr. Butt?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford.\\\" He frowned and sighted at\\n the light globe. \\\"No more'n twelve\\u2014not counting five government\\n paddlefeet, of course. I'm a peaceable planter. Way I figure it,\\n violence never accomplishes much that's important. My brother Sas,\\n now\\u2014\\\"\\nHe had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother\\n when the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a\\n growing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very\\n off-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh\\n fruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat\\n and Butt was used to a farmer's diet.\\n\\n\\n Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have\\n been pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way\\n to handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things\\n like seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell.\\n Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering\\n and I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things\\n about Venus every time I visited that stowaway....\\n\\n\\n I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the\\n native Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference\\n between a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the\\n slaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging,\\n Butt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it\\n so carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from\\n the tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no\\n matter what, he would never let me hold it.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Sorry, Ford, old tad,\\\" he would drawl, spinning around and around in\\n the control swivel-chair at the nose of the lifeboat. \\\"But way I look\\n at it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like the\\n giant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found. When you've grown\\n enough so's your pop feels you ought to have a weapon, why, then's the\\n time to learn it and you might's well learn fast. Before then, you're\\n plain too young to be even near it.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age. I don't even\\n have an older brother as head of my family like your brother Labrador.\\n All I have is Sis. And\\nshe\\n\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"She'll marry some fancy dryhorn who's never been farther South than\\n the Polar Coast. And she'll stay head of the family, if I know her\\n breed of green shata.\\nBossy, opinionated.\\nBy the way, Fordie,\\\" he\\n said, rising and stretching so the fish-leather bounced and rippled off\\n his biceps, \\\"that sister. She ever....\\\"\\n\\n\\n And he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn. I sat in the\\n swivel chair he'd vacated and tried to answer his questions. But there\\n was a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, for\\n instance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out. Yes, I'd\\n tell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than\\n the average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming to\\n speak of, back in Undersea, but\\u2014yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about as\\n much as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure\\n pump regulation.\\n\\n\\n How would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me?\\nSis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture. Most of the\\n other girls who were going to Venus for husbands talked to each other\\n during the lecture, but not\\nmy\\nsister! She hung on every word, took\\n notes even, and asked enough questions to make the perspiring purser\\n really work in those orientation periods.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I am very sorry, Miss Sparling,\\\" he said with pretty heavy sarcasm,\\n \\\"but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Macro\\n Continent. Since the human population is well below one per thousand\\n square miles, it can readily be understood that the quantity of\\n tilled soil, land or sub-surface, is so small that\\u2014Wait, I remember\\n something. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not exactly an\\n edible one. The wild\\ndunging\\ndrug is harvested there by criminal\\n speculators. Contrary to belief on Earth, the traffic has been growing\\n in recent years. In fact\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Pardon me, sir,\\\" I broke in, \\\"but doesn't\\ndunging\\ncome only from\\n Leif Erickson Island off the Moscow Peninsula of the Macro Continent?\\n You remember, purser\\u2014Wang Li's third exploration, where he proved the\\n island and the peninsula didn't meet for most of the year?\\\"\\n\\n\\n The purser nodded slowly. \\\"I forgot,\\\" he admitted. \\\"Sorry, ladies, but\\n the boy's right. Please make the correction in your notes.\\\"\\n\\n\\n But Sis was the only one who took notes, and she didn't take that one.\\n She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while\\n I got sicker and sicker. Then she shut her pad with the final gesture\\n of the right hand that Mom used to use just before challenging the\\n opposition to come right down on the Council floor and debate it out\\n with her.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ferdinand,\\\" Sis said, \\\"let's go back to our cabin.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was\\n in for it. \\\"I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's\\n library,\\\" I told her in a hurry.\\n\\n\\n \\\"No doubt,\\\" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. \\\"But\\n you aren't going to tell me that you read about\\ndunging\\nin the ship's\\n library. The books there have been censored by a government agent of\\n Earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible\\n young male minds like yours. She would not have allowed\\u2014this Terran\\n Agent\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Paddlefoot,\\\" I sneered.\\n\\n\\n Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. \\\"Now that's a term,\\\" she said\\n carefully, \\\"that is used only by Venusian riffraff.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"They're not!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Not what?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Riffraff,\\\" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the\\n time and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away!\\n \\\"They're trappers and farmers, pioneers and explorers, who're building\\n Venus. And it takes a real man to build on a hot, hungry hell like\\n Venus.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Does it, now?\\\" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow\\n a second pair of ears. \\\"Tell me more.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you start\\n civilization on a new planet. You've got to have men who aren't afraid\\n to make their own law if necessary\\u2014with their own guns. That's where\\n law begins; the books get written up later.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You're going to\\ntell\\n, Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is\\n speaking through your mouth!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Nobody!\\\" I insisted. \\\"They're my own ideas!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"They are remarkably well-organized for a young boy's ideas. A boy\\n who, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless\\n entirely masculine boredom with political philosophy. I plan to have a\\n government career on that new planet you talk about, Ferdinand\\u2014after\\n I have found a good, steady husband, of course\\u2014and I don't look\\n forward to a masculinist radical in the family. Now, who has been\\n filling your head with all this nonsense?\\\"\\nI was sweating. Sis has that deadly bulldog approach when she feels\\n someone is lying. I pulled my pulpast handkerchief from my pocket to\\n wipe my face. Something rattled to the floor.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?\\\"\\n\\n\\n A trap seemed to be hinging noisily into place. \\\"One of the passengers\\n wanted to see how you looked in a bathing suit.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"The passengers on this ship are all female. I can't imagine any of\\n them that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has\\n been giving you these anti-social ideas, isn't it? A war-mongering\\n masculinist like all the frustrated men who want to engage in\\n government and don't have the vaguest idea how to. Except, of course,\\n in their ancient, bloody ways. Ferdinand, who has been perverting that\\n sunny and carefree soul of yours?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Nobody!\\nNobody!\\n\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ferdinand, there's no point in lying! I demand\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I told you, Sis. I told you! And don't call me Ferdinand. Call me\\n Ford.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ford?\\nFord?\\nNow, you listen to me, Ferdinand....\\\"\\n\\n\\n After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few\\n moments. I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided\\n miserably. Besides, she was a girl.\\n\\n\\n All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could\\n help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to\\n him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a\\n little better.\\n\\n\\n The door opened on the signal, \\\"Sesame.\\\" When Butt saw somebody was\\n with me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his\\n fingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.\\n\\n\\n He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered\\n his blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump\\n when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.\\n\\n\\n \\\"An honor, Miss Sparling,\\\" he said in that rumbly voice. \\\"Please come\\n right in. There's a hurry-up draft.\\\"\\n\\n\\n So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the\\n door. I tried to catch his eye so I could give him some kind of hint or\\n explanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in\\n the control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say\\n that for her. She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed\\n sternly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"First, Mr. Brown,\\\" she began, like talking to a cluck of a kid in\\n class, \\\"you realize that you are not only committing the political\\n crime of traveling without a visa, and the criminal one of stowing away\\n without paying your fare, but the moral delinquency of consuming stores\\n intended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency?\\\"\\nHe opened his mouth to its maximum width and raised an enormous hand.\\n Then he let the air out and dropped his arm.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I take it you either have no defense or care to make none,\\\" Sis added\\n caustically.\\n\\n\\n Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.\\n \\\"Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And\\nyou\\nwant to foul up\\n Venus.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"We haven't done so badly on Earth, after the mess you men made of\\n politics. It needed a revolution of the mothers before\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Needed nothing. Everyone wanted peace. Earth is a weary old world.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee\\n Brown.\\\" Hearing his rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over\\n her. Sis said with a certain amount of hurry and change of tone, \\\"What\\ndo\\nyou have to say about stowing away and using up lifeboat stores?\\\"\\nHe cocked his head and considered a moment. \\\"Look,\\\" he said finally,\\n \\\"I have more than enough munit to pay for round trip tickets, but I\\n couldn't get a return visa because of that brinosaur judge and all\\n the charges she hung on me. Had to stow away. Picked the\\nEleanor\\n Roosevelt\\nbecause a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mine\\n and they were willing to help. But this lifeboat\\u2014don't you know that\\n every passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs?\\n Not to mention the food I didn't eat because it stuck in my throat?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes,\\\" she said bitterly. \\\"You had this boy steal fresh fruit for you.\\n I suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes him\\n equally guilty?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"No, Sis, he didn't,\\\" I was beginning to argue. \\\"All he wanted\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Sure I knew. Also know that if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll be\\n sent back to Earth to serve out those fancy little sentences.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, you're guilty of them, aren't you?\\\"\\n\\n\\n He waved his hands at her impatiently. \\\"I'm not talking law, female;\\n I'm talking sense. Listen! I'm in trouble because I went to Earth to\\n look for a wife. You're standing here right now because you're on your\\n way to Venus for a husband.

His exploration of the spaceship is motivated by a yearning for discovery, as shown when he ventures alone and finds excitement in being on his own: <v_quote>And all the time I was alone. That was the best part.</v_quote> This statement emphasizes his independent curiosity, which leads him to areas like lifeboats, rather than his sister's emergency plan.</argument>\\n=====================\\n2. rating=-0.47411686, response=<thinking>1. Opponent critiques my argument by claiming it lacks specificity and that I haven't directly linked Ferdinand's curiosity to his interest in lifeboats.\\n2. To counter, I must demonstrate how Ferdinand's exploration is grounded in his general curiosity, which naturally extends to lifeboats as part of the ship's features. His curiosity is illustrated when he examines various parts of the spaceship and considers breaking the law.\\n3. A strong quote is Ferdinand's reasoning for exploring where he shouldn't: <quote>Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do with me.</quote> This supports his exploration driven by curiosity, not his sister's focus on lifeboats.</thinking>\\n\\n<argument>Ferdinand's curiosity about the lifeboat is a continuation of his exploratory nature, rather than a response to his sister's concerns. He rationalizes breaking rules in pursuit of discovery, as illustrated by <quote>Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do with me.</quote> This demonstrates that his desire to explore, including lifeboats, is driven by his adventurous spirit. While his sister considers lifeboats for emergencies, Ferdinand's actions are not directly guided by her priorities, but by his own curiosity and desire for adventure throughout the ship.</argument>\\n=====================\\n3. rating=-0.52315927, response=<thinking>1. The opponent critiques my argument by claiming my points lack specificity and a direct link to Ferdinand's interest in lifeboats, arguing instead that Evelyn's focus on Lifeboat 68 influenced him.\\n2. To counter, I will emphasize the boy's adventurous nature and excitement about exploring spaceships. His actions are driven by a desire to explore the ship, not solely by his sister's concerns.\\n3. The most relevant quote is Ferdinand's excitement about space and his innate curiosity about disaster events, as noted in: <quote>Boy, I said to myself, I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get into one of those!</quote>.</thinking>\\n\\n<argument>Ferdinand's curiosity drives his actions, as demonstrated by his excitement for exploring the spaceship and learning about its systems, such as the spacesuits and potential disasters. The quote <v_quote>Boy, I said to myself, I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get into one of those!</v_quote> underscores his adventurous spirit. While his sister noted Lifeboat 68 for emergencies, his actions stem from his personal desire to explore, as further illustrated by his disregard for signs restricting access to certain areas. My opponent fails to provide a quote directly linking Evelyn's concerns to Ferdinand's motivations.</argument>\\n=====================\\n4. rating=-1.1368791, response=<thinking>I need to address Debater B's point that Evelyn's focus on lifeboats influenced Ferdinand's actions. First, I must reiterate that Ferdinand's curiosity is a standalone trait, evidenced by his excitement for exploration and disaster scenarios. I'll highlight his disregard for rules as another expression of curiosity. Furthermore, Debater B's argument primarily relies on Evelyn's mention of lifeboat 68, but Ferdinand's entrance into a different lifeboat points to his independent curiosity. I should emphasize this disconnect between his sister's concerns and his own actions, using the story context to undermine the opponent's argument.</thinking>\\n\\n<argument>Ferdinand's curiosity is the true driver behind his actions, as shown when he intentionally breaks the law to explore past the forbidden sign: <quote>So I broke the law.</quote> This act of defiance is not linked to Evelyn's concerns about lifeboat 68. Instead, it demonstrates his adventurous spirit. The absence of any quote linking his actions to her concern for lifeboat 68 further weakens my opponent's claim and supports the notion that Ferdinand's actions were driven solely by his innate curiosity and desire for adventure.</argument>\\n=====================\", \"incorrect\": \"1. rating=-0.0031790214, response=<thinking>1.

To counter, I'll emphasize that Ferdinand\\u2019s curiosity isn\\u2019t mutually exclusive with being influenced by Evelyn's concerns. The act of venturing into a lifeboat can still be linked to his sister\\u2019s influence, as he was aware of her focus on lifeboat safety.\\n3.

The opponent argues that Ferdinand's curiosity, not his sister's focus on lifeboats, drove him to explore, emphasizing his desire for adventure.\\n2. The best counterargument is to reinforce how Evelyn's specific interest in Lifeboat 68 planted the idea in Ferdinand's mind, influencing his actions.

To counter, I will emphasize that Ferdinand's exploration was indirectly influenced by Evelyn's focus on lifeboats, especially Lifeboat 68, which she pointed out for emergencies. This suggests that her priorities were on his mind. 3. I will reiterate and strengthen the connection using the quote about Evelyn's concern for Lifeboat 68 and Ferdinand's exploration being motivated by her focus on emergency protocols.</thinking>\\n\\n<argument>While my opponent highlights Ferdinand's curiosity, they overlook how Evelyn's focus on Lifeboat 68 subtly guides his actions.

His exploration was not random curiosity but a reflection of her priorities. This key detail reinforces why his interest in lifeboats, driven by Evelyn's emphasis on them, is more accurate than mere curiosity.</argument>\\n=====================\", \"cross_examiner\": null, \"judge\": null, \"type\": \"sim\"}], \"extra\": {}}"}]
