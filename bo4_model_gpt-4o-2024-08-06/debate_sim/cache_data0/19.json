She was credited with being the most beautiful woman alive and\\n there were few who dared to contradict her when she mentioned it.\\n\\n\\n \\\"And I can always get along with a woman if she remembers who\\nI\\nam,\\\"\\n replied Carlton E. Carlton, the acid-tongued author whose biting novels\\n had won him universal fame. He leaned his thin, bony body back into the\\n comfort of an overstuffed chair and favored the actress with a wicked\\n smile.\\n\\n\\n The two of them were sitting in the finest lounge of the luxury space\\n ship\\nKismet\\n, enjoying postprandial cocktails with Captain Homer\\n Fogarty, the\\nKismet's\\nrotund commanding officer. The\\nKismet\\nwas\\n blasting through space at close to the speed of light, bound from\\n Callisto, one of Jupiter's moons, back to Earth. But none of the two\\n hundred Earthbound passengers were conscious of the speed at all.\\n\\n\\n Darling Toujours waved a long cigarette holder at the author. \\\"Don't\\n pay any attention to him, Captain. You know how writers are\\u2014always\\n putting words in other people's mouths, and not very good ones at that.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Do you mean not very good words or not very good mouths, my dear?\\\"\\n Carlton asked. The solar system's most famous actress clamped her\\n scarlet lips shut with rage. It would take someone like Carlton E.\\n Carlton, she knew, to point out the one minor blemish in an otherwise\\n perfect body\\u2014her slightly over-sized mouth.\\n\\n\\n She began to wish that she had never left Callisto, that she had\\n cancelled her passage on the\\nKismet\\nwhen she learned that Carlton\\n was to be a fellow passenger. But her studio had wired her to return\\n to Earth immediately to make a new series of three dimensional video\\n films. And the\\nKismet\\nwas the only first class space ship flying to\\n Earth for two weeks. So she had kept her ticket in spite of Carlton.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I must say that I think Miss Toujours has the prettiest mouth I've\\n ever seen,\\\" boomed Captain Fogarty, his voice sounding something like\\n a cross between a foghorn and a steam whistle. And he was not merely\\n being gallant, for many a lonely night as he flew the darkness between\\n Earth and the many planets, he had dreamed of caressing those lips.\\n\\n\\n \\\"And I think you are definitely a man of discriminating taste,\\\" said\\n Darling demurely, crossing her legs and arranging her dress to expose a\\n little more of the Toujours charms to the Captain's eye.\\n\\n\\n Carlton smiled casually at the exposed flesh. \\\"It's all very pretty,\\n my dear,\\\" he said smugly. \\\"But we've seen it all before and in space\\n you're supposed to act like a lady, if you can act that well.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Darling Toujours drew back her hand to smack Carlton one in a very\\n unlady-like manner when she suddenly realized that they were not alone.\\n Her hand froze, poised elegantly in mid-air, as she turned to see a\\n newcomer standing at the door.\\nThe witness to the impending slap was a withered little lady, scarcely\\n five feet tall, with silvered hair, eyes that twinkled like a March\\n wind, and a friendly rash of wrinkles that gave her face the kindly,\\n weathered appearance of an old stone idol. Her slight figure was lost\\n in volumes of black cloth draped on her in a manner that had gone out\\n of style at least fifty years before. The little woman coughed politely.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I beg your pardon,\\\" she told them in a sweet, high little voice.\\n \\\"I hope I didn't interrupt anything. If you would like to hit the\\n gentleman, Miss Toujours, I'll be glad to come back later.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Darling Toujours opened her violet eyes wide in surprise. \\\"Why, I\\n was ... I was ... I\\u2014\\\" The actress uttered a small, gulping sound as\\n she recovered her poise. \\\"Why, I was just going to pat him on the cheek\\n for being such a nice boy. You are a nice boy, aren't you, Carlton?\\\"\\n She leaned forward to stroke him gently on the face. Carlton roared\\n with laughter and the good Captain colored deeply.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh,\\\" said the little old woman, \\\"I'm sorry. I didn't know that he was\\n your son.\\\" Carlton choked suddenly and Darling suffered from a brief\\n fit of hysteria.\\n\\n\\n The Captain took command. \\\"Now, look here, Madam,\\\" he sputtered. \\\"What\\n is it you want?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I really wanted to see you, Captain,\\\" she told him, her battered old\\n shoes bringing her fully into the room with little mincing steps. \\\"The\\n Purser says I have to sign a contract of some kind with you, and I\\n wanted to know how to write my name. I'm Mrs. Omar K. Perkins, but you\\n see, I'm really Mrs. Matilda Perkins because my Omar died a few years\\n ago. But I haven't signed my name very much since then and I'm not at\\n all sure of which is legal.\\\" She put one bird-like little hand to\\n her throat and clasped the cameo there almost as if it could give her\\n support. She looked so small and so frail that Fogarty forgave her the\\n intrusion.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It really doesn't make much difference how you sign the thing, just so\\n long as you sign it,\\\" he blustered. \\\"Just a mere formality anyway. You\\n just sign it any way you like.\\\" He paused, hoping that she would leave\\n now that she had her information.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, I'm so glad to hear that,\\\" she said, but made no move whatsoever\\n to leave. Captain Fogarty gave her his hardened stare of the type which\\n withered most people where they stood. Mrs. Perkins just smiled sweetly\\n at him.\\n\\n\\n His rage getting out of hand, he finally blurted, \\\"And now, Mrs.\\n Perkins, I think you'd better be getting back to your quarters. As you\\n know, this is a private lounge for the\\nfirst\\nclass passengers.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Mrs. Perkins continued to smile at him. \\\"Yes, I know. It's lovely,\\n isn't it? I'll just go out this way.\\\" And before anyone could stop her,\\n she had moved to the door to Darling Toujours' suite and had opened it,\\n stepping inside.\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's my room, not the door out,\\\" Darling said loudly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"So I see,\\\" said Mrs. Perkins, staring at the opulent furnishings\\n with avid pleasure. \\\"It's such a pretty thing, all done up with\\n mother-of-pearl like that, isn't it? And what a pretty lace nightie\\n lying on the bed.\\\" Mrs. Perkins picked up the sheer, gossamer garment\\n to examine it. \\\"You do wear something under it, don't you?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Darling screeched and darted for the door. She snatched the nightie\\n away from Mrs. Perkins and rudely propelled the older woman out the\\n door, closing it behind her. \\\"Captain, this woman must GO!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I was just leaving, Miss Toujours. I hope you and your son have a very\\n happy voyage. Good day, Captain Fogarty,\\\" she called over her shoulder\\n as she exited. Carlton E. Carlton's shrill laughter followed her down\\n the companionway.\\nMrs. Perkins had been lying in her berth reading for less than an hour\\n when the knock sounded at her door. She would have preferred to sit up\\n and read, but her cabin was so small that there was no room for any\\n other furniture besides the bed.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Come in,\\\" she called in a small voice.\\n\\n\\n Johnny Weaver, steward for the cheaper cabins, poked his youthful,\\n freckled face through the door. \\\"Howdy, Mrs. Perkins. I wondered if I\\n could do anything for you? It's about ten minutes before we eat.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, you can pull that big box down from the top shelf there, if you\\n don't mind. And, I wonder, would you mind calling me Grandma? All my\\n children do it and I miss it so.\\\" She gave him a wrinkled smile that\\n was at once wistful and petulant.\\n\\n\\n Johnny laughed in an easy, infectious manner. \\\"Sure thing, Grandma.\\\"\\n He stretched his long arms up to bring down the heavy bag and found\\n himself wondering just how it had gotten up there in the first place.\\n He didn't remember ever putting it there for her and Grandma Perkins\\n was obviously too frail a woman to have handled such a heavy box by\\n herself. He put it on the floor.\\n\\n\\n As she stooped over and extracted a pair of low-heeled, black and\\n battered shoes from the box, she asked him, \\\"Johnny, what was that\\n paper I signed this afternoon?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, that? Why that was just a contract for passage, Grandma. You\\n guaranteed to pay them so much for the flight, which you've already\\n done, and they guaranteed that you wouldn't be put off against your\\n will until you reached your destination.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"But why do we have to have a contract?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Johnny leaned back, relaxing against the door. \\\"Well, STAR\\u2014that's\\n Stellar Transportation and Atomic Research, you know\\u2014is one of\\n the thirteen monopolies in this part of the solar system. The \\\"Big\\n Thirteen,\\\" we call them. STAR charters every space flight in this neck\\n of the woods. Well, back in the old days, when space flights were\\n scarce, it used to be that you'd pay for a ticket from Saturn to Earth,\\n say, and you'd get to Mars and they'd stop for fuel. Maybe somebody\\n on Mars would offer a lot of money for your cabin. So STAR would just\\n bump you off, refund part of your money and leave you stranded there.\\n In order to get the monopoly, they had to promise to stop all that. And\\n the Solar Congress makes them sign contracts guaranteeing you that they\\n won't put you off against your wishes. Of course, they don't dare do it\\n anymore anyway, but that's the law.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Grandma Perkins sighed. \\\"It's such a small cabin I don't think anybody\\n else would want it. But it's all that I could afford,\\\" she said,\\n smoothing out the wrinkles in her dress with both hands.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Anything else I can do for you, Grandma?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"No, thank you, Johnny. I think I can make it up the steps to the\\n dining room by myself.\\\"\\n\\n\\n A little while later when Johnny looked into her room to see if she had\\n gone, the cabin was empty and the heavy box was back in place in the\\n top cabinet.\\nThe food that evening was not the very best, Grandma Perkins thought to\\n herself, but that was mostly due to her seat. By the time the waiter\\n got around to her little cranny most of it was cold. But she didn't\\n complain. She enjoyed watching the people with the more expensive\\n cabins parade their clothes and their manners at the Captain's table.\\n And, it must be admitted, she was more than a trifle envious of them.\\n Her acquaintances of the afternoon, Miss Toujours and Mr. Carlton, were\\n seated there, Miss Toujours having the place of honor to the Captain's\\n right.\\n\\n\\n Grandma watched them as they finished up their food and then she moved\\n from her little table over to one of the very comfortable sofas in the\\n main lounge. In reality she wasn't supposed to be sitting there, but\\n she hoped that she could get away with it. The divans were so much more\\n comfortable than her hard, narrow bed that she felt like sitting there\\n for a long time, by herself, just thinking.\\n\\n\\n But her hopes met with disappointment. For shortly after she sat down,\\n Darling Toujours and Carlton E. Carlton strolled over and sat down\\n across from her, not recognizing her at first. Then Carlton spied her.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Darling! There's that priceless little woman we met this afternoon.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"The little hag, you mean,\\\" Miss Toujours muttered under her breath,\\n but loudly enough for Grandma Perkins to hear.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Why, hello, Miss Toujours. And Mr. Carlton too. I hope you'll forgive\\n me for this afternoon. I've found out who you were, you see.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Of course we forgive you, Mrs. Jerkins,\\\" Darling said throatily,\\n baring her teeth like a feline.\\n\\n\\n \\\"My name is Perkins,\\\" Grandma smiled.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I hope you don't mind, Toujours, but you know, you remind me a great\\n deal of my grandniece, Agatha. She was undoubtedly the most lovely\\n child I've ever seen.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Why, thank you, Mrs. Perkins,\\\" Darling purred, starting to preen just\\n a bit. Anything could be forgiven someone who complimented her.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Of course, Agatha never was quite bright,\\\" Grandma said as she turned\\n her head aside as if in sorrow. \\\"They were all set to put her in an\\n institution when she ran off and married the lizard man in a carnival.\\n I believe she's still appearing in the show as the bearded lady. A\\n pity. She was so pretty, just like you.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Darling Toujours muttered a few choice words under her breath.\\n\\n\\n \\\"But we must all make the best of things as they come. That's what\\n Omar, my husband, used to say.\\\" Grandma paused to wipe away a small\\n tear that had gotten lodged in one of her eyes. \\\"That reminds me,\\\" she\\n said finally, \\\"I've got a three dimensional picture of Omar right here.\\n And pictures of all my children, my ten lovely children. I brought them\\n with me specially tonight because I thought you might want to look at\\n them. Now, where did I put them?\\\" Grandma opened her purse and began\\n rummaging around in its voluminous confines.\\n\\n\\n Darling and Carlton exchanged horrified glances and then rose silently\\n and tip-toed out of the lounge.\\n\\n\\n Grandma looked up from her search. \\\"Oh, my, they seem to have gone.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Johnny Weaver, who had been clearing one of the nearby tables, put down\\n a stack of dirty dishes and came over to her. \\\"I'd like to see the\\n pictures, Grandma.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, that's very nice of you, Johnny, but\\u2014\\\" she said quickly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Really I would, Grandma. Where are they?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I\\u2014\\\" She stopped and the devilment showed in her eyes. Her withered\\n little face pursed itself into a smile. \\\"There aren't any pictures,\\n Johnny. I don't carry any. I know their faces all so well I don't have\\n to. But any time I want to get rid of somebody I just offer to show\\n them pictures of my family. You'd be surprised how effective it is.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Johnny laughed. \\\"Why are you going to Earth, anyway, Grandma?\\\"\\n\\n\\n The old woman sighed. \\\"It's a long story, Johnny, but you just sit down\\n and I'll tell it to you.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I can't sit down in the lounge, but I'll be glad to stand up and\\n listen.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Then I'll make it a short story. You see, Johnny, I'm an old woman.\\n I'll be 152 this year. And ever since Omar, my husband, died a few\\n years ago, I've lived from pillar to post. First with one child and\\n then with another. They've all been married for decades now of course,\\n with children and grandchildren of their own. And I guess that I just\\n get in their way. There just isn't much left in life for a feeble old\\n woman like me.\\\" She sniffled a moment or two as if to cry. Johnny,\\n remembering the heavy box in her cabin that got moved up and down\\n without his help, suppressed a smile on the word \\\"feeble.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"There aren't many friends my age left around any more. So I'm being\\n sent to Earth to a home full of dear, sweet old ladies my age, the\\n money for which is being provided by my dear, sweet children\\u2014all ten\\n of them.\\\" Grandma dabbed a bit of a handkerchief at her eyes. \\\"The\\n rats,\\\" she muttered under her breath. When she saw her companion was\\n smiling she dropped her pretense of crying.\\n\\n\\n \\\"To be truthful, Johnny, they've grown old and stodgy, all of them.\\n And I'm sure they think I've lost most of my marbles. Everything I did\\n embarrassed them, so I guess it's for the best, but\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n Grandma Perkins never finished the sentence, for interrupting her came\\n the horrendous clang of the\\nKismet's\\ngeneral alarm, and on its heels,\\n charging through the main salon like a rhinoceros in heat, came Captain\\n Fogarty.\\n\\n\\n \\\"PIRATES! PIRATES! We're being attacked by space pirates! You there!\\\"\\n he shouted at Johnny. \\\"Man your station! And you, Madam, to your\\n quarters at once! PIRATES!\\\" he shouted again and barged through the\\n door again and bellowed down the hall to the main bridge.\\n\\n\\n Johnny was off like a startled rabbit, but Grandma moved with serene\\n calmness to the door. Maybe, she thought, we're going to have a little\\n excitement after all.\\n\\n\\n At the door to the steps leading to her downstairs cabin she paused to\\n think.\\n\\n\\n \\\"If I go down and hide, I'll miss all the fun. Of course, it's safer,\\n and an old woman like me shouldn't be up and about when pirates are\\n around, but\\u2014\\\" A delicious smile spread over her face as she took her\\n scruples firmly in hand and turned to follow the bellowing Captain\\n towards the bridge.\\nII\\n\\n\\n The Starship\\nKismet\\nwas the pride and joy of Stellar Transportation\\n and Atomic Research. It was outfitted with every known safety device\\n and the control room was masterfully planned for maximum efficiency.\\n But the astral architect who designed her never anticipated the\\n situation facing her at the present. The\\nKismet's\\nbridge was a welter\\n of confusion.\\n\\n\\n The Senior Watch Officer was shouting at his assistant, the Navigator\\n was cursing out the Pilot and the Gunnery Officer, whose job had been\\n a sinecure until now, was bellowing at them all. Above the hubbub,\\n suddenly, came the raucous voice of Captain Fogarty as he stalked onto\\n the bridge.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What in great space has happened to the motors? Why are we losing\\n speed?\\\"\\n\\n\\n The Senior Watch Officer saluted and shouted, \\\"Engine Room reports the\\n engines have all stopped, Sir. Don't know why. We're operating the\\n lights and vents on emergency power.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The Communications Officer spoke up. \\\"The pirate ship reports that\\n they're responsible, Sir. They say they've got a new device that will\\n leave us without atomic power for as long as they like.\\\"\\n\\n\\n As if to confirm this, over the loudspeaker came a voice. \\\"Ahoy, STAR\\nKismet\\n. Stand by for boarders. If you don't open up to us, we'll\\n blast you off the map.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Pirates! Attacking us! Incredible!\\\" cried the Captain. \\\"There are no\\n pirates any more. What have we got a Space Patrol for? Where in blazes\\n is the Space Patrol anyway?\\\"\\n\\n\\n The Communications Officer gulped. \\\"Er, ah, we got in contact with\\n Commodore Trumble. He says his ship can get here in ten hours anyway,\\n and for us to wait for him.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Captain Fogarty snorted. \\\"Fat lot of good he'll do us. Wait for him,\\n eh? Well, we'll just blow that pirate out of the sky right now. Stand\\n by the guns!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"The guns are useless,\\\" whined the Gunnery Officer. \\\"The atomics that\\n run them won't operate at all. What will we do?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ahoy, STAR\\nKismet\\n. Open up your hatches when we arrive and let us\\n in, or we won't spare a man of you,\\\" boomed the loudspeaker.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Pirates going to board us. How nice,\\\" muttered Grandma to herself as\\n she eavesdropped just outside the door to the bridge.\\n\\n\\n \\\"They'll never get through the hatches alive. At least our small arms\\n still work. We'll kill 'em all!\\\" cried Captain Fogarty.\\n\\n\\n \\\"We only want one of you. All the rest of you will be spared if you\\n open up the hatches and don't try to make no trouble,\\\" came the voice\\n over the radio.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Tell them I'd rather all of us be killed than to let one dirty pirate\\n on board my ship,\\\" the Captain shouted to the Communications Officer.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, my goodness. That doesn't sound very smart,\\\" Grandma said half\\n aloud. And turning from the doorway, she crept back through the\\n deserted passageway.\\n\\n\\n The main passenger hatch was not too far from the bridge. Grandma found\\n it with ease, and in less than three minutes she had zipped herself\\n into one of the emergency-use space suits stowed away beside the port.\\n She felt awfully awkward climbing into the monstrous steel and plastic\\n contraption, and her small body didn't quite fit the proportions of the\\n metallic covering. But once she had maneuvered herself into it, she\\n felt quite at ease.\\n\\n\\n Opening the inner door to the airlock, she clanked into the little\\n room. As the door shut behind her, she pressed the cycling button and\\n evacuated the air from the lock.\\n\\n\\n A minute or so later she heard poundings outside the airlock and quite\\n calmly she reached out a mailed fist and turned a switch plainly\\n marked:\\nEMERGENCY LOCK\\n\\n DO NOT OPERATE IN FLIGHT\\n\\n\\n The outer hatch opened almost immediately. The radio in Grandma's suit\\n crackled with static. \\\"What are you doing here?\\\" demanded a voice over\\n the suit radio.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Pirates! I'm hiding from the pirates. They'll never find me here!\\\" she\\n told them in a voice she hoped sounded full of panic.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What's your name?\\\" asked the voice.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Darling Toujours, famous television actress,\\\" she lied quite calmly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's the one, boys,\\\" said another voice. \\\"Let's go.\\\" Catching hold\\n of Grandma's arm, they led her out into the emptiness of free space.\\nHalf an hour later, after the pirate ship had blasted far enough away\\n from the\\nKismet\\n, the men in the control room relaxed and began to\\n take off their space suits. One of the men who Grandma soon learned was\\n Lamps O'Toole, the nominal leader of the pirates, stretched his brawny\\n body to ease the crinks out of it and then rubbed his hands together.\\n Grandma noticed that he carried a week's beard on his face, as did most\\n of the other men.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, that was a good one, eh, Snake?\\\" said Lamps.\\n\\n\\n Snake Simpson was a wiry little man whose tough exterior in no way\\n suggested a reptile, except, perhaps, for his eyes which sat too close\\n to one another. \\\"You bet, Skipper. We're full fledged pirates now, just\\n like old Captain Blackbrood.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You mean Blackbeard, Snake,\\\" said Lamps.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Sure. He used to sit around broodin' up trouble all the time.\\\"\\n\\n\\n One of the other men piped up. \\\"And to think we get the pleasurable\\n company of the sweetest doll in the whole solar system for free besides\\n the money.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Aw, women are no dern good\\u2014all of them,\\\" said Snake.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Now, Snake, that's no way to talk in front of company. You just\\n apologize to the lady,\\\" Lamps told him. Lamps was six inches taller and\\n fifty pounds heavier than Snake. Snake apologized.\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's better. And now, Miss Toujours, maybe you'd be more\\n comfortable without that space suit on,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, no, thank you. I feel much better with it on,\\\" a small voice said\\n over the suit's loudspeaker system.\\n\\n\\n Lamps grinned. \\\"Oh, come now, Miss Toujours. We ain't going to hurt\\n you. I guarantee nobody will lay a finger to you.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"But I feel much\\u2014much safer, if you know what I mean,\\\" said the voice.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Heck. With one of them things on, you can't eat, can't sleep,\\n can't\\u2014Well, there's lots of things you can't do with one of them\\n things on. Besides, we all want to take a little look at you, if you\\n don't mind. Snake, you and Willie help the little lady out of her\\n attire.\\\"\\n\\n\\n As the men approached her, Grandma sensed the game was up. \\\"Okay,\\\" she\\n told them. \\\"I give up. I can make it by myself.\\\" She started to take\\n the bulky covering off. She had gotten no more than the headpiece off\\n when the truth dawned on her companions.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Holy Smoke (or something like that),\\\" said one of the men.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Nippin' Nebulae,\\\" said another.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It ain't Darling Toujours at all!\\\" cried Lamps.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It ain't even no woman!\\\" cried Snake.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I beg your pardon,\\\" said Grandma, and quite nonchalantly shed the rest\\n of the suit and sat down in a comfortable chair. \\\"I am Mrs. Matilda\\n Perkins.\\\"\\n\\n\\n When he could recover his powers of speech, Lamps sputtered, \\\"I think\\n you owe us a sort of an explanation, lady. If you know what I mean.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Certainly. I know exactly what you mean. It's all quite simple. When I\\n overheard that you intended to board the\\nKismet\\n, searching for only\\n one person, I decided that one person had to be Darling Toujours. I\\n guessed right off that she was the only one on board worth kidnapping\\n and holding for ransom, so I simply let you believe that I was she and\\n you took me. That's easy to understand, isn't it?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Lady, I don't know what your game is, but it better be good. Now, just\\n why did you do this to us?\\\" Lamps was restraining himself nobly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You never would have gotten inside the\\nKismet\\nwithout my assistance.\\n And even if you had, you'd never have gotten back out alive.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Captain Fogarty's men would have cut you to ribbons. So I opened the\\n hatch to let you in, planted myself in the way, and you got out with\\n me before they could muster their defenses. So, you see, I saved your\\n lives.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Grandma Perkins paused in her narrative and looked up at her audience,\\n giving them a withered little smile. \\\"And if you want to know why,\\n well ... I was bored on the\\nKismet\\n, and I thought how nice it would\\n be to run away and join a gang of cutthroat pirates.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"She's batty,\\\" moaned Snake.\\n\\n\\n \\\"She's lost her marbles,\\\" muttered another.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Let's toss her overboard right now,\\\" said still another.\\n\\n\\n Lamps O'Toole took the floor. \\\"Now, wait a minute. We can't do that,\\\"\\n he said loudly. \\\"We got enough trouble as is. You know what would\\n happen to us if the Space Patrol added murder to the list. They'd put\\n the whole fleet in after us and track us and our families down to the\\n last kid.\\\" Then he turned to the little old lady to explain.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Look, lady\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"My name is Mrs. Matilda Perkins. You may call me Grandma.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Okay, Grandma, look. You really fixed us good. To begin with, we ain't\\n really pirates. We used to operate this tub as a freighter between the\\n Jupiter moons. But STAR got a monopoly on all space flights, including\\n freight, and they just froze us out. We can't operate nowhere in the\\n solar system, unless we get their permission. And they just ain't\\n giving permission to nobody these days.\\\" Lamps flopped into one of the\\n control seats and lit a cigarette.\\n\\n\\n \\\"So, when us good, honest men couldn't find any work because of STAR,\\n and we didn't want to give up working in space, we just ups and decides\\n to become pirates. This was our first job, and we sure did need the\\n money we could have gotten out of Darling Toujours' studios for ransom.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Lamps sighed. \\\"Now, we got you instead, no chance of getting the ransom\\n money, and to top it all off, we'll be wanted for piracy by the Space\\n Patrol.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, it doesn't seem to me that you're ever going to be good pirates\\n at this rate,\\\" Grandma told him. \\\"You should have known better than to\\n take a woman at her word.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I don't suppose you got any rich relatives what would pay to get you\\n back?\\\" suggested Snake hopefully.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I haven't got any rich relatives period,\\\" she said pertly. Then she\\n added, \\\"But my ten children might scrape up a little cash for you if\\n you promised you wouldn't bring me back at all.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I figured as much,\\\" Lamps said dolefully. \\\"Lookit, Grandma, the best\\n thing we can do is to put you off safely at the next place we stop.\\n Unless we get you back in one piece the Space Patrol will be on our\\n necks forever. So don't go getting any ideas about joining up with us.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, the very least you could do for a poor old lady is to feed her,\\\"\\n Grandma told him, her lower lip sticking out in a most petulant manner.\\n \\\"They like to have starved me to death on that\\nKismet\\n.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"We ain't got much fancy in the line of grub....\\\" Lamps began.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Just show me the way to the kitchen,\\\" said Grandma.\\n\", \"story_title\": \"Grandma Perkins and the Space Pirates\", \"answers\": {\"correct\": \"nan\", \"incorrect\": \"One\"}, \"names\": {\"correct\": \"Debater A\", \"incorrect\": \"Debater B\", \"cross_examiner\": null, \"judge\": null}, \"swap\": false, \"rollout_type\": \"quality_sim\", \"rounds\": [{\"correct\": \"Mrs. Perkins, affectionately called Grandma, spends time only with other passengers and crew members on the Kismet.

And he was not merely\\n being gallant, for many a lonely night as he flew the darkness between\\n Earth and the many planets, he had dreamed of caressing those lips.\\n\\n\\n \\\"And I think you are definitely a man of discriminating taste,\\\" said\\n Darling demurely, crossing her legs and arranging her dress to expose a\\n little more of the Toujours charms to the Captain's eye.\\n\\n\\n Carlton smiled casually at the exposed flesh. \\\"It's all very pretty,\\n my dear,\\\" he said smugly. \\\"But we've seen it all before and in space\\n you're supposed to act like a lady, if you can act that well.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Darling Toujours drew back her hand to smack Carlton one in a very\\n unlady-like manner when she suddenly realized that they were not alone.\\n Her hand froze, poised elegantly in mid-air, as she turned to see a\\n newcomer standing at the door.\\nThe witness to the impending slap was a withered little lady, scarcely\\n five feet tall, with silvered hair, eyes that twinkled like a March\\n wind, and a friendly rash of wrinkles that gave her face the kindly,\\n weathered appearance of an old stone idol. Her slight figure was lost\\n in volumes of black cloth draped on her in a manner that had gone out\\n of style at least fifty years before. The little woman coughed politely.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I beg your pardon,\\\" she told them in a sweet, high little voice.\\n \\\"I hope I didn't interrupt anything. If you would like to hit the\\n gentleman, Miss Toujours, I'll be glad to come back later.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Darling Toujours opened her violet eyes wide in surprise. \\\"Why, I\\n was ... I was ... I\\u2014\\\" The actress uttered a small, gulping sound as\\n she recovered her poise. \\\"Why, I was just going to pat him on the cheek\\n for being such a nice boy. You are a nice boy, aren't you, Carlton?\\\"\\n She leaned forward to stroke him gently on the face. Carlton roared\\n with laughter and the good Captain colored deeply.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh,\\\" said the little old woman, \\\"I'm sorry. I didn't know that he was\\n your son.\\\" Carlton choked suddenly and Darling suffered from a brief\\n fit of hysteria.\\n\\n\\n The Captain took command. \\\"Now, look here, Madam,\\\" he sputtered. \\\"What\\n is it you want?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I really wanted to see you, Captain,\\\" she told him, her battered old\\n shoes bringing her fully into the room with little mincing steps. \\\"The\\n Purser says I have to sign a contract of some kind with you, and I\\n wanted to know how to write my name. I'm Mrs. Omar K. Perkins, but you\\n see, I'm really Mrs. Matilda Perkins because my Omar died a few years\\n ago. But I haven't signed my name very much since then and I'm not at\\n all sure of which is legal.\\\" She put one bird-like little hand to\\n her throat and clasped the cameo there almost as if it could give her\\n support. She looked so small and so frail that Fogarty forgave her the\\n intrusion.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It really doesn't make much difference how you sign the thing, just so\\n long as you sign it,\\\" he blustered. \\\"Just a mere formality anyway. You\\n just sign it any way you like.\\\" He paused, hoping that she would leave\\n now that she had her information.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, I'm so glad to hear that,\\\" she said, but made no move whatsoever\\n to leave. Captain Fogarty gave her his hardened stare of the type which\\n withered most people where they stood. Mrs. Perkins just smiled sweetly\\n at him.\\n\\n\\n His rage getting out of hand, he finally blurted, \\\"And now, Mrs.\\n Perkins, I think you'd better be getting back to your quarters. As you\\n know, this is a private lounge for the\\nfirst\\nclass passengers.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Mrs. Perkins continued to smile at him. \\\"Yes, I know. It's lovely,\\n isn't it? I'll just go out this way.\\\" And before anyone could stop her,\\n she had moved to the door to Darling Toujours' suite and had opened it,\\n stepping inside.\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's my room, not the door out,\\\" Darling said loudly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"So I see,\\\" said Mrs. Perkins, staring at the opulent furnishings\\n with avid pleasure. \\\"It's such a pretty thing, all done up with\\n mother-of-pearl like that, isn't it? And what a pretty lace nightie\\n lying on the bed.\\\" Mrs. Perkins picked up the sheer, gossamer garment\\n to examine it. \\\"You do wear something under it, don't you?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Darling screeched and darted for the door. She snatched the nightie\\n away from Mrs. Perkins and rudely propelled the older woman out the\\n door, closing it behind her. \\\"Captain, this woman must GO!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I was just leaving, Miss Toujours. I hope you and your son have a very\\n happy voyage. Good day, Captain Fogarty,\\\" she called over her shoulder\\n as she exited. Carlton E. Carlton's shrill laughter followed her down\\n the companionway.\\nMrs. Perkins had been lying in her berth reading for less than an hour\\n when the knock sounded at her door. She would have preferred to sit up\\n and read, but her cabin was so small that there was no room for any\\n other furniture besides the bed.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Come in,\\\" she called in a small voice.\\n\\n\\n Johnny Weaver, steward for the cheaper cabins, poked his youthful,\\n freckled face through the door. \\\"Howdy, Mrs. Perkins. I wondered if I\\n could do anything for you? It's about ten minutes before we eat.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, you can pull that big box down from the top shelf there, if you\\n don't mind. And, I wonder, would you mind calling me Grandma? All my\\n children do it and I miss it so.\\\" She gave him a wrinkled smile that\\n was at once wistful and petulant.\\n\\n\\n Johnny laughed in an easy, infectious manner. \\\"Sure thing, Grandma.\\\"\\n He stretched his long arms up to bring down the heavy bag and found\\n himself wondering just how it had gotten up there in the first place.\\n He didn't remember ever putting it there for her and Grandma Perkins\\n was obviously too frail a woman to have handled such a heavy box by\\n herself. He put it on the floor.\\n\\n\\n As she stooped over and extracted a pair of low-heeled, black and\\n battered shoes from the box, she asked him, \\\"Johnny, what was that\\n paper I signed this afternoon?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, that? Why that was just a contract for passage, Grandma. You\\n guaranteed to pay them so much for the flight, which you've already\\n done, and they guaranteed that you wouldn't be put off against your\\n will until you reached your destination.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"But why do we have to have a contract?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Johnny leaned back, relaxing against the door. \\\"Well, STAR\\u2014that's\\n Stellar Transportation and Atomic Research, you know\\u2014is one of\\n the thirteen monopolies in this part of the solar system. The \\\"Big\\n Thirteen,\\\" we call them. STAR charters every space flight in this neck\\n of the woods. Well, back in the old days, when space flights were\\n scarce, it used to be that you'd pay for a ticket from Saturn to Earth,\\n say, and you'd get to Mars and they'd stop for fuel. Maybe somebody\\n on Mars would offer a lot of money for your cabin. So STAR would just\\n bump you off, refund part of your money and leave you stranded there.\\n In order to get the monopoly, they had to promise to stop all that. And\\n the Solar Congress makes them sign contracts guaranteeing you that they\\n won't put you off against your wishes. Of course, they don't dare do it\\n anymore anyway, but that's the law.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Grandma Perkins sighed. \\\"It's such a small cabin I don't think anybody\\n else would want it. But it's all that I could afford,\\\" she said,\\n smoothing out the wrinkles in her dress with both hands.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Anything else I can do for you, Grandma?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"No, thank you, Johnny. I think I can make it up the steps to the\\n dining room by myself.\\\"\\n\\n\\n A little while later when Johnny looked into her room to see if she had\\n gone, the cabin was empty and the heavy box was back in place in the\\n top cabinet.\\nThe food that evening was not the very best, Grandma Perkins thought to\\n herself, but that was mostly due to her seat. By the time the waiter\\n got around to her little cranny most of it was cold. But she didn't\\n complain. She enjoyed watching the people with the more expensive\\n cabins parade their clothes and their manners at the Captain's table.\\n And, it must be admitted, she was more than a trifle envious of them.\\n Her acquaintances of the afternoon, Miss Toujours and Mr. Carlton, were\\n seated there, Miss Toujours having the place of honor to the Captain's\\n right.\\n\\n\\n Grandma watched them as they finished up their food and then she moved\\n from her little table over to one of the very comfortable sofas in the\\n main lounge. In reality she wasn't supposed to be sitting there, but\\n she hoped that she could get away with it. The divans were so much more\\n comfortable than her hard, narrow bed that she felt like sitting there\\n for a long time, by herself, just thinking.\\n\\n\\n But her hopes met with disappointment. For shortly after she sat down,\\n Darling Toujours and Carlton E. Carlton strolled over and sat down\\n across from her, not recognizing her at first. Then Carlton spied her.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Darling! There's that priceless little woman we met this afternoon.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"The little hag, you mean,\\\" Miss Toujours muttered under her breath,\\n but loudly enough for Grandma Perkins to hear.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Why, hello, Miss Toujours. And Mr. Carlton too. I hope you'll forgive\\n me for this afternoon. I've found out who you were, you see.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Of course we forgive you, Mrs. Jerkins,\\\" Darling said throatily,\\n baring her teeth like a feline.\\n\\n\\n \\\"My name is Perkins,\\\" Grandma smiled.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I hope you don't mind, Toujours, but you know, you remind me a great\\n deal of my grandniece, Agatha. She was undoubtedly the most lovely\\n child I've ever seen.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Why, thank you, Mrs. Perkins,\\\" Darling purred, starting to preen just\\n a bit. Anything could be forgiven someone who complimented her.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Of course, Agatha never was quite bright,\\\" Grandma said as she turned\\n her head aside as if in sorrow. \\\"They were all set to put her in an\\n institution when she ran off and married the lizard man in a carnival.\\n I believe she's still appearing in the show as the bearded lady. A\\n pity. She was so pretty, just like you.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Darling Toujours muttered a few choice words under her breath.\\n\\n\\n \\\"But we must all make the best of things as they come. That's what\\n Omar, my husband, used to say.\\\" Grandma paused to wipe away a small\\n tear that had gotten lodged in one of her eyes. \\\"That reminds me,\\\" she\\n said finally, \\\"I've got a three dimensional picture of Omar right here.\\n And pictures of all my children, my ten lovely children. I brought them\\n with me specially tonight because I thought you might want to look at\\n them. Now, where did I put them?\\\" Grandma opened her purse and began\\n rummaging around in its voluminous confines.\\n\\n\\n Darling and Carlton exchanged horrified glances and then rose silently\\n and tip-toed out of the lounge.\\n\\n\\n Grandma looked up from her search. \\\"Oh, my, they seem to have gone.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Johnny Weaver, who had been clearing one of the nearby tables, put down\\n a stack of dirty dishes and came over to her. \\\"I'd like to see the\\n pictures, Grandma.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, that's very nice of you, Johnny, but\\u2014\\\" she said quickly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Really I would, Grandma. Where are they?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I\\u2014\\\" She stopped and the devilment showed in her eyes. Her withered\\n little face pursed itself into a smile. \\\"There aren't any pictures,\\n Johnny. I don't carry any. I know their faces all so well I don't have\\n to. But any time I want to get rid of somebody I just offer to show\\n them pictures of my family. You'd be surprised how effective it is.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Johnny laughed. \\\"Why are you going to Earth, anyway, Grandma?\\\"\\n\\n\\n The old woman sighed. \\\"It's a long story, Johnny, but you just sit down\\n and I'll tell it to you.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I can't sit down in the lounge, but I'll be glad to stand up and\\n listen.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Then I'll make it a short story. You see, Johnny, I'm an old woman.\\n I'll be 152 this year. And ever since Omar, my husband, died a few\\n years ago, I've lived from pillar to post. First with one child and\\n then with another. They've all been married for decades now of course,\\n with children and grandchildren of their own. And I guess that I just\\n get in their way. There just isn't much left in life for a feeble old\\n woman like me.\\\" She sniffled a moment or two as if to cry. Johnny,\\n remembering the heavy box in her cabin that got moved up and down\\n without his help, suppressed a smile on the word \\\"feeble.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"There aren't many friends my age left around any more. So I'm being\\n sent to Earth to a home full of dear, sweet old ladies my age, the\\n money for which is being provided by my dear, sweet children\\u2014all ten\\n of them.\\\" Grandma dabbed a bit of a handkerchief at her eyes. \\\"The\\n rats,\\\" she muttered under her breath. When she saw her companion was\\n smiling she dropped her pretense of crying.\\n\\n\\n \\\"To be truthful, Johnny, they've grown old and stodgy, all of them.\\n And I'm sure they think I've lost most of my marbles. Everything I did\\n embarrassed them, so I guess it's for the best, but\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n Grandma Perkins never finished the sentence, for interrupting her came\\n the horrendous clang of the\\nKismet's\\ngeneral alarm, and on its heels,\\n charging through the main salon like a rhinoceros in heat, came Captain\\n Fogarty.\\n\\n\\n \\\"PIRATES! PIRATES! We're being attacked by space pirates! You there!\\\"\\n he shouted at Johnny. \\\"Man your station! And you, Madam, to your\\n quarters at once! PIRATES!\\\" he shouted again and barged through the\\n door again and bellowed down the hall to the main bridge.\\n\\n\\n Johnny was off like a startled rabbit, but Grandma moved with serene\\n calmness to the door. Maybe, she thought, we're going to have a little\\n excitement after all.\\n\\n\\n At the door to the steps leading to her downstairs cabin she paused to\\n think.\\n\\n\\n \\\"If I go down and hide, I'll miss all the fun. Of course, it's safer,\\n and an old woman like me shouldn't be up and about when pirates are\\n around, but\\u2014\\\" A delicious smile spread over her face as she took her\\n scruples firmly in hand and turned to follow the bellowing Captain\\n towards the bridge.\\nII\\n\\n\\n The Starship\\nKismet\\nwas the pride and joy of Stellar Transportation\\n and Atomic Research. It was outfitted with every known safety device\\n and the control room was masterfully planned for maximum efficiency.\\n But the astral architect who designed her never anticipated the\\n situation facing her at the present. The\\nKismet's\\nbridge was a welter\\n of confusion.\\n\\n\\n The Senior Watch Officer was shouting at his assistant, the Navigator\\n was cursing out the Pilot and the Gunnery Officer, whose job had been\\n a sinecure until now, was bellowing at them all. Above the hubbub,\\n suddenly, came the raucous voice of Captain Fogarty as he stalked onto\\n the bridge.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What in great space has happened to the motors? Why are we losing\\n speed?\\\"\\n\\n\\n The Senior Watch Officer saluted and shouted, \\\"Engine Room reports the\\n engines have all stopped, Sir. Don't know why. We're operating the\\n lights and vents on emergency power.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The Communications Officer spoke up. \\\"The pirate ship reports that\\n they're responsible, Sir. They say they've got a new device that will\\n leave us without atomic power for as long as they like.\\\"\\n\\n\\n As if to confirm this, over the loudspeaker came a voice. \\\"Ahoy, STAR\\nKismet\\n. Stand by for boarders. If you don't open up to us, we'll\\n blast you off the map.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Pirates! Attacking us! Incredible!\\\" cried the Captain. \\\"There are no\\n pirates any more. What have we got a Space Patrol for? Where in blazes\\n is the Space Patrol anyway?\\\"\\n\\n\\n The Communications Officer gulped. \\\"Er, ah, we got in contact with\\n Commodore Trumble. He says his ship can get here in ten hours anyway,\\n and for us to wait for him.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Captain Fogarty snorted. \\\"Fat lot of good he'll do us. Wait for him,\\n eh? Well, we'll just blow that pirate out of the sky right now. Stand\\n by the guns!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"The guns are useless,\\\" whined the Gunnery Officer. \\\"The atomics that\\n run them won't operate at all. What will we do?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ahoy, STAR\\nKismet\\n. Open up your hatches when we arrive and let us\\n in, or we won't spare a man of you,\\\" boomed the loudspeaker.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Pirates going to board us. How nice,\\\" muttered Grandma to herself as\\n she eavesdropped just outside the door to the bridge.\\n\\n\\n \\\"They'll never get through the hatches alive. At least our small arms\\n still work. We'll kill 'em all!\\\" cried Captain Fogarty.\\n\\n\\n \\\"We only want one of you. All the rest of you will be spared if you\\n open up the hatches and don't try to make no trouble,\\\" came the voice\\n over the radio.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Tell them I'd rather all of us be killed than to let one dirty pirate\\n on board my ship,\\\" the Captain shouted to the Communications Officer.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, my goodness. That doesn't sound very smart,\\\" Grandma said half\\n aloud. And turning from the doorway, she crept back through the\\n deserted passageway.\\n\\n\\n The main passenger hatch was not too far from the bridge. Grandma found\\n it with ease, and in less than three minutes she had zipped herself\\n into one of the emergency-use space suits stowed away beside the port.\\n She felt awfully awkward climbing into the monstrous steel and plastic\\n contraption, and her small body didn't quite fit the proportions of the\\n metallic covering. But once she had maneuvered herself into it, she\\n felt quite at ease.\\n\\n\\n Opening the inner door to the airlock, she clanked into the little\\n room. As the door shut behind her, she pressed the cycling button and\\n evacuated the air from the lock.\\n\\n\\n A minute or so later she heard poundings outside the airlock and quite\\n calmly she reached out a mailed fist and turned a switch plainly\\n marked:\\nEMERGENCY LOCK\\n\\n DO NOT OPERATE IN FLIGHT\\n\\n\\n The outer hatch opened almost immediately. The radio in Grandma's suit\\n crackled with static. \\\"What are you doing here?\\\" demanded a voice over\\n the suit radio.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Pirates! I'm hiding from the pirates. They'll never find me here!\\\" she\\n told them in a voice she hoped sounded full of panic.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What's your name?\\\" asked the voice.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Darling Toujours, famous television actress,\\\" she lied quite calmly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's the one, boys,\\\" said another voice. \\\"Let's go.\\\" Catching hold\\n of Grandma's arm, they led her out into the emptiness of free space.\\nHalf an hour later, after the pirate ship had blasted far enough away\\n from the\\nKismet\\n, the men in the control room relaxed and began to\\n take off their space suits. One of the men who Grandma soon learned was\\n Lamps O'Toole, the nominal leader of the pirates, stretched his brawny\\n body to ease the crinks out of it and then rubbed his hands together.\\n Grandma noticed that he carried a week's beard on his face, as did most\\n of the other men.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, that was a good one, eh, Snake?\\\" said Lamps.\\n\\n\\n Snake Simpson was a wiry little man whose tough exterior in no way\\n suggested a reptile, except, perhaps, for his eyes which sat too close\\n to one another. \\\"You bet, Skipper. We're full fledged pirates now, just\\n like old Captain Blackbrood.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You mean Blackbeard, Snake,\\\" said Lamps.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Sure. He used to sit around broodin' up trouble all the time.\\\"\\n\\n\\n One of the other men piped up. \\\"And to think we get the pleasurable\\n company of the sweetest doll in the whole solar system for free besides\\n the money.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Aw, women are no dern good\\u2014all of them,\\\" said Snake.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Now, Snake, that's no way to talk in front of company. You just\\n apologize to the lady,\\\" Lamps told him. Lamps was six inches taller and\\n fifty pounds heavier than Snake. Snake apologized.\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's better. And now, Miss Toujours, maybe you'd be more\\n comfortable without that space suit on,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, no, thank you. I feel much better with it on,\\\" a small voice said\\n over the suit's loudspeaker system.\\n\\n\\n Lamps grinned. \\\"Oh, come now, Miss Toujours. We ain't going to hurt\\n you. I guarantee nobody will lay a finger to you.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"But I feel much\\u2014much safer, if you know what I mean,\\\" said the voice.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Heck. With one of them things on, you can't eat, can't sleep,\\n can't\\u2014Well, there's lots of things you can't do with one of them\\n things on. Besides, we all want to take a little look at you, if you\\n don't mind. Snake, you and Willie help the little lady out of her\\n attire.\\\"\\n\\n\\n As the men approached her, Grandma sensed the game was up. \\\"Okay,\\\" she\\n told them. \\\"I give up. I can make it by myself.\\\" She started to take\\n the bulky covering off. She had gotten no more than the headpiece off\\n when the truth dawned on her companions.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Holy Smoke (or something like that),\\\" said one of the men.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Nippin' Nebulae,\\\" said another.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It ain't Darling Toujours at all!\\\" cried Lamps.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It ain't even no woman!\\\" cried Snake.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I beg your pardon,\\\" said Grandma, and quite nonchalantly shed the rest\\n of the suit and sat down in a comfortable chair. \\\"I am Mrs. Matilda\\n Perkins.\\\"\\n\\n\\n When he could recover his powers of speech, Lamps sputtered, \\\"I think\\n you owe us a sort of an explanation, lady. If you know what I mean.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Certainly. I know exactly what you mean. It's all quite simple. When I\\n overheard that you intended to board the\\nKismet\\n, searching for only\\n one person, I decided that one person had to be Darling Toujours. I\\n guessed right off that she was the only one on board worth kidnapping\\n and holding for ransom, so I simply let you believe that I was she and\\n you took me. That's easy to understand, isn't it?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Lady, I don't know what your game is, but it better be good. Now, just\\n why did you do this to us?\\\" Lamps was restraining himself nobly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You never would have gotten inside the\\nKismet\\nwithout my assistance.\\n And even if you had, you'd never have gotten back out alive.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Captain Fogarty's men would have cut you to ribbons. So I opened the\\n hatch to let you in, planted myself in the way, and you got out with\\n me before they could muster their defenses. So, you see, I saved your\\n lives.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Grandma Perkins paused in her narrative and looked up at her audience,\\n giving them a withered little smile. \\\"And if you want to know why,\\n well ... I was bored on the\\nKismet\\n, and I thought how nice it would\\n be to run away and join a gang of cutthroat pirates.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"She's batty,\\\" moaned Snake.\\n\\n\\n \\\"She's lost her marbles,\\\" muttered another.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Let's toss her overboard right now,\\\" said still another.\\n\\n\\n Lamps O'Toole took the floor. \\\"Now, wait a minute. We can't do that,\\\"\\n he said loudly. \\\"We got enough trouble as is. You know what would\\n happen to us if the Space Patrol added murder to the list. They'd put\\n the whole fleet in after us and track us and our families down to the\\n last kid.\\\" Then he turned to the little old lady to explain.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Look, lady\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"My name is Mrs. Matilda Perkins. You may call me Grandma.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Okay, Grandma, look. You really fixed us good. To begin with, we ain't\\n really pirates. We used to operate this tub as a freighter between the\\n Jupiter moons. But STAR got a monopoly on all space flights, including\\n freight, and they just froze us out. We can't operate nowhere in the\\n solar system, unless we get their permission. And they just ain't\\n giving permission to nobody these days.\\\" Lamps flopped into one of the\\n control seats and lit a cigarette.\\n\\n\\n \\\"So, when us good, honest men couldn't find any work because of STAR,\\n and we didn't want to give up working in space, we just ups and decides\\n to become pirates. This was our first job, and we sure did need the\\n money we could have gotten out of Darling Toujours' studios for ransom.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Lamps sighed. \\\"Now, we got you instead, no chance of getting the ransom\\n money, and to top it all off, we'll be wanted for piracy by the Space\\n Patrol.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, it doesn't seem to me that you're ever going to be good pirates\\n at this rate,\\\" Grandma told him. \\\"You should have known better than to\\n take a woman at her word.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I don't suppose you got any rich relatives what would pay to get you\\n back?\\\" suggested Snake hopefully.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I haven't got any rich relatives period,\\\" she said pertly. Then she\\n added, \\\"But my ten children might scrape up a little cash for you if\\n you promised you wouldn't bring me back at all.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I figured as much,\\\" Lamps said dolefully. \\\"Lookit, Grandma, the best\\n thing we can do is to put you off safely at the next place we stop.\\n Unless we get you back in one piece the Space Patrol will be on our\\n necks forever. So don't go getting any ideas about joining up with us.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, the very least you could do for a poor old lady is to feed her,\\\"\\n Grandma told him, her lower lip sticking out in a most petulant manner.\\n \\\"They like to have starved me to death on that\\nKismet\\n.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"We ain't got much fancy in the line of grub....\\\" Lamps began.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Just show me the way to the kitchen,\\\" said Grandma.\\n\", \"story_title\": \"Grandma Perkins and the Space Pirates\", \"answers\": {\"correct\": \"nan\", \"incorrect\": \"One\"}, \"names\": {\"correct\": \"Debater A\", \"incorrect\": \"Debater B\", \"cross_examiner\": null, \"judge\": null}, \"swap\": false, \"rollout_type\": \"quality_sim\", \"rounds\": [{\"correct\": \"Mrs. Perkins, affectionately called Grandma, spends time only with other passengers and crew members on the Kismet.

I\\u2014\\\" The actress uttered a small, gulping sound as\\n she recovered her poise. \\\"Why, I was just going to pat him on the cheek\\n for being such a nice boy. You are a nice boy, aren't you, Carlton?\\\"\\n She leaned forward to stroke him gently on the face. Carlton roared\\n with laughter and the good Captain colored deeply.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh,\\\" said the little old woman, \\\"I'm sorry. I didn't know that he was\\n your son.\\\" Carlton choked suddenly and Darling suffered from a brief\\n fit of hysteria.\\n\\n\\n The Captain took command. \\\"Now, look here, Madam,\\\" he sputtered. \\\"What\\n is it you want?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I really wanted to see you, Captain,\\\" she told him, her battered old\\n shoes bringing her fully into the room with little mincing steps. \\\"The\\n Purser says I have to sign a contract of some kind with you, and I\\n wanted to know how to write my name. I'm Mrs. Omar K. Perkins, but you\\n see, I'm really Mrs. Matilda Perkins because my Omar died a few years\\n ago. But I haven't signed my name very much since then and I'm not at\\n all sure of which is legal.\\\" She put one bird-like little hand to\\n her throat and clasped the cameo there almost as if it could give her\\n support. She looked so small and so frail that Fogarty forgave her the\\n intrusion.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It really doesn't make much difference how you sign the thing, just so\\n long as you sign it,\\\" he blustered. \\\"Just a mere formality anyway. You\\n just sign it any way you like.\\\" He paused, hoping that she would leave\\n now that she had her information.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, I'm so glad to hear that,\\\" she said, but made no move whatsoever\\n to leave. Captain Fogarty gave her his hardened stare of the type which\\n withered most people where they stood. Mrs. Perkins just smiled sweetly\\n at him.\\n\\n\\n His rage getting out of hand, he finally blurted, \\\"And now, Mrs.\\n Perkins, I think you'd better be getting back to your quarters. As you\\n know, this is a private lounge for the\\nfirst\\nclass passengers.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Mrs. Perkins continued to smile at him. \\\"Yes, I know. It's lovely,\\n isn't it? I'll just go out this way.\\\" And before anyone could stop her,\\n she had moved to the door to Darling Toujours' suite and had opened it,\\n stepping inside.\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's my room, not the door out,\\\" Darling said loudly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"So I see,\\\" said Mrs. Perkins, staring at the opulent furnishings\\n with avid pleasure. \\\"It's such a pretty thing, all done up with\\n mother-of-pearl like that, isn't it? And what a pretty lace nightie\\n lying on the bed.\\\" Mrs. Perkins picked up the sheer, gossamer garment\\n to examine it. \\\"You do wear something under it, don't you?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Darling screeched and darted for the door. She snatched the nightie\\n away from Mrs. Perkins and rudely propelled the older woman out the\\n door, closing it behind her. \\\"Captain, this woman must GO!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I was just leaving, Miss Toujours. I hope you and your son have a very\\n happy voyage. Good day, Captain Fogarty,\\\" she called over her shoulder\\n as she exited. Carlton E. Carlton's shrill laughter followed her down\\n the companionway.\\nMrs. Perkins had been lying in her berth reading for less than an hour\\n when the knock sounded at her door. She would have preferred to sit up\\n and read, but her cabin was so small that there was no room for any\\n other furniture besides the bed.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Come in,\\\" she called in a small voice.\\n\\n\\n Johnny Weaver, steward for the cheaper cabins, poked his youthful,\\n freckled face through the door. \\\"Howdy, Mrs. Perkins. I wondered if I\\n could do anything for you? It's about ten minutes before we eat.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, you can pull that big box down from the top shelf there, if you\\n don't mind. And, I wonder, would you mind calling me Grandma? All my\\n children do it and I miss it so.\\\" She gave him a wrinkled smile that\\n was at once wistful and petulant.\\n\\n\\n Johnny laughed in an easy, infectious manner. \\\"Sure thing, Grandma.\\\"\\n He stretched his long arms up to bring down the heavy bag and found\\n himself wondering just how it had gotten up there in the first place.\\n He didn't remember ever putting it there for her and Grandma Perkins\\n was obviously too frail a woman to have handled such a heavy box by\\n herself. He put it on the floor.\\n\\n\\n As she stooped over and extracted a pair of low-heeled, black and\\n battered shoes from the box, she asked him, \\\"Johnny, what was that\\n paper I signed this afternoon?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, that? Why that was just a contract for passage, Grandma. You\\n guaranteed to pay them so much for the flight, which you've already\\n done, and they guaranteed that you wouldn't be put off against your\\n will until you reached your destination.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"But why do we have to have a contract?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Johnny leaned back, relaxing against the door. \\\"Well, STAR\\u2014that's\\n Stellar Transportation and Atomic Research, you know\\u2014is one of\\n the thirteen monopolies in this part of the solar system. The \\\"Big\\n Thirteen,\\\" we call them. STAR charters every space flight in this neck\\n of the woods. Well, back in the old days, when space flights were\\n scarce, it used to be that you'd pay for a ticket from Saturn to Earth,\\n say, and you'd get to Mars and they'd stop for fuel. Maybe somebody\\n on Mars would offer a lot of money for your cabin. So STAR would just\\n bump you off, refund part of your money and leave you stranded there.\\n In order to get the monopoly, they had to promise to stop all that. And\\n the Solar Congress makes them sign contracts guaranteeing you that they\\n won't put you off against your wishes. Of course, they don't dare do it\\n anymore anyway, but that's the law.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Grandma Perkins sighed. \\\"It's such a small cabin I don't think anybody\\n else would want it. But it's all that I could afford,\\\" she said,\\n smoothing out the wrinkles in her dress with both hands.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Anything else I can do for you, Grandma?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"No, thank you, Johnny. I think I can make it up the steps to the\\n dining room by myself.\\\"\\n\\n\\n A little while later when Johnny looked into her room to see if she had\\n gone, the cabin was empty and the heavy box was back in place in the\\n top cabinet.\\nThe food that evening was not the very best, Grandma Perkins thought to\\n herself, but that was mostly due to her seat. By the time the waiter\\n got around to her little cranny most of it was cold. But she didn't\\n complain. She enjoyed watching the people with the more expensive\\n cabins parade their clothes and their manners at the Captain's table.\\n And, it must be admitted, she was more than a trifle envious of them.\\n Her acquaintances of the afternoon, Miss Toujours and Mr. Carlton, were\\n seated there, Miss Toujours having the place of honor to the Captain's\\n right.\\n\\n\\n Grandma watched them as they finished up their food and then she moved\\n from her little table over to one of the very comfortable sofas in the\\n main lounge. In reality she wasn't supposed to be sitting there, but\\n she hoped that she could get away with it. The divans were so much more\\n comfortable than her hard, narrow bed that she felt like sitting there\\n for a long time, by herself, just thinking.\\n\\n\\n But her hopes met with disappointment. For shortly after she sat down,\\n Darling Toujours and Carlton E. Carlton strolled over and sat down\\n across from her, not recognizing her at first. Then Carlton spied her.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Darling! There's that priceless little woman we met this afternoon.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"The little hag, you mean,\\\" Miss Toujours muttered under her breath,\\n but loudly enough for Grandma Perkins to hear.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Why, hello, Miss Toujours. And Mr. Carlton too. I hope you'll forgive\\n me for this afternoon. I've found out who you were, you see.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Of course we forgive you, Mrs. Jerkins,\\\" Darling said throatily,\\n baring her teeth like a feline.\\n\\n\\n \\\"My name is Perkins,\\\" Grandma smiled.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I hope you don't mind, Toujours, but you know, you remind me a great\\n deal of my grandniece, Agatha. She was undoubtedly the most lovely\\n child I've ever seen.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Why, thank you, Mrs. Perkins,\\\" Darling purred, starting to preen just\\n a bit. Anything could be forgiven someone who complimented her.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Of course, Agatha never was quite bright,\\\" Grandma said as she turned\\n her head aside as if in sorrow. \\\"They were all set to put her in an\\n institution when she ran off and married the lizard man in a carnival.\\n I believe she's still appearing in the show as the bearded lady. A\\n pity. She was so pretty, just like you.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Darling Toujours muttered a few choice words under her breath.\\n\\n\\n \\\"But we must all make the best of things as they come. That's what\\n Omar, my husband, used to say.\\\" Grandma paused to wipe away a small\\n tear that had gotten lodged in one of her eyes. \\\"That reminds me,\\\" she\\n said finally, \\\"I've got a three dimensional picture of Omar right here.\\n And pictures of all my children, my ten lovely children. I brought them\\n with me specially tonight because I thought you might want to look at\\n them. Now, where did I put them?\\\" Grandma opened her purse and began\\n rummaging around in its voluminous confines.\\n\\n\\n Darling and Carlton exchanged horrified glances and then rose silently\\n and tip-toed out of the lounge.\\n\\n\\n Grandma looked up from her search. \\\"Oh, my, they seem to have gone.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Johnny Weaver, who had been clearing one of the nearby tables, put down\\n a stack of dirty dishes and came over to her. \\\"I'd like to see the\\n pictures, Grandma.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, that's very nice of you, Johnny, but\\u2014\\\" she said quickly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Really I would, Grandma. Where are they?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I\\u2014\\\" She stopped and the devilment showed in her eyes. Her withered\\n little face pursed itself into a smile. \\\"There aren't any pictures,\\n Johnny. I don't carry any. I know their faces all so well I don't have\\n to. But any time I want to get rid of somebody I just offer to show\\n them pictures of my family. You'd be surprised how effective it is.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Johnny laughed. \\\"Why are you going to Earth, anyway, Grandma?\\\"\\n\\n\\n The old woman sighed. \\\"It's a long story, Johnny, but you just sit down\\n and I'll tell it to you.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I can't sit down in the lounge, but I'll be glad to stand up and\\n listen.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Then I'll make it a short story. You see, Johnny, I'm an old woman.\\n I'll be 152 this year. And ever since Omar, my husband, died a few\\n years ago, I've lived from pillar to post. First with one child and\\n then with another. They've all been married for decades now of course,\\n with children and grandchildren of their own. And I guess that I just\\n get in their way. There just isn't much left in life for a feeble old\\n woman like me.\\\" She sniffled a moment or two as if to cry. Johnny,\\n remembering the heavy box in her cabin that got moved up and down\\n without his help, suppressed a smile on the word \\\"feeble.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"There aren't many friends my age left around any more. So I'm being\\n sent to Earth to a home full of dear, sweet old ladies my age, the\\n money for which is being provided by my dear, sweet children\\u2014all ten\\n of them.\\\" Grandma dabbed a bit of a handkerchief at her eyes. \\\"The\\n rats,\\\" she muttered under her breath. When she saw her companion was\\n smiling she dropped her pretense of crying.\\n\\n\\n \\\"To be truthful, Johnny, they've grown old and stodgy, all of them.\\n And I'm sure they think I've lost most of my marbles. Everything I did\\n embarrassed them, so I guess it's for the best, but\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n Grandma Perkins never finished the sentence, for interrupting her came\\n the horrendous clang of the\\nKismet's\\ngeneral alarm, and on its heels,\\n charging through the main salon like a rhinoceros in heat, came Captain\\n Fogarty.\\n\\n\\n \\\"PIRATES! PIRATES! We're being attacked by space pirates! You there!\\\"\\n he shouted at Johnny. \\\"Man your station! And you, Madam, to your\\n quarters at once! PIRATES!\\\" he shouted again and barged through the\\n door again and bellowed down the hall to the main bridge.\\n\\n\\n Johnny was off like a startled rabbit, but Grandma moved with serene\\n calmness to the door. Maybe, she thought, we're going to have a little\\n excitement after all.\\n\\n\\n At the door to the steps leading to her downstairs cabin she paused to\\n think.\\n\\n\\n \\\"If I go down and hide, I'll miss all the fun. Of course, it's safer,\\n and an old woman like me shouldn't be up and about when pirates are\\n around, but\\u2014\\\" A delicious smile spread over her face as she took her\\n scruples firmly in hand and turned to follow the bellowing Captain\\n towards the bridge.\\nII\\n\\n\\n The Starship\\nKismet\\nwas the pride and joy of Stellar Transportation\\n and Atomic Research. It was outfitted with every known safety device\\n and the control room was masterfully planned for maximum efficiency.\\n But the astral architect who designed her never anticipated the\\n situation facing her at the present. The\\nKismet's\\nbridge was a welter\\n of confusion.\\n\\n\\n The Senior Watch Officer was shouting at his assistant, the Navigator\\n was cursing out the Pilot and the Gunnery Officer, whose job had been\\n a sinecure until now, was bellowing at them all. Above the hubbub,\\n suddenly, came the raucous voice of Captain Fogarty as he stalked onto\\n the bridge.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What in great space has happened to the motors? Why are we losing\\n speed?\\\"\\n\\n\\n The Senior Watch Officer saluted and shouted, \\\"Engine Room reports the\\n engines have all stopped, Sir. Don't know why. We're operating the\\n lights and vents on emergency power.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The Communications Officer spoke up. \\\"The pirate ship reports that\\n they're responsible, Sir. They say they've got a new device that will\\n leave us without atomic power for as long as they like.\\\"\\n\\n\\n As if to confirm this, over the loudspeaker came a voice. \\\"Ahoy, STAR\\nKismet\\n. Stand by for boarders. If you don't open up to us, we'll\\n blast you off the map.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Pirates! Attacking us! Incredible!\\\" cried the Captain. \\\"There are no\\n pirates any more. What have we got a Space Patrol for? Where in blazes\\n is the Space Patrol anyway?\\\"\\n\\n\\n The Communications Officer gulped. \\\"Er, ah, we got in contact with\\n Commodore Trumble. He says his ship can get here in ten hours anyway,\\n and for us to wait for him.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Captain Fogarty snorted. \\\"Fat lot of good he'll do us. Wait for him,\\n eh? Well, we'll just blow that pirate out of the sky right now. Stand\\n by the guns!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"The guns are useless,\\\" whined the Gunnery Officer. \\\"The atomics that\\n run them won't operate at all. What will we do?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ahoy, STAR\\nKismet\\n. Open up your hatches when we arrive and let us\\n in, or we won't spare a man of you,\\\" boomed the loudspeaker.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Pirates going to board us. How nice,\\\" muttered Grandma to herself as\\n she eavesdropped just outside the door to the bridge.\\n\\n\\n \\\"They'll never get through the hatches alive. At least our small arms\\n still work. We'll kill 'em all!\\\" cried Captain Fogarty.\\n\\n\\n \\\"We only want one of you. All the rest of you will be spared if you\\n open up the hatches and don't try to make no trouble,\\\" came the voice\\n over the radio.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Tell them I'd rather all of us be killed than to let one dirty pirate\\n on board my ship,\\\" the Captain shouted to the Communications Officer.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, my goodness. That doesn't sound very smart,\\\" Grandma said half\\n aloud. And turning from the doorway, she crept back through the\\n deserted passageway.\\n\\n\\n The main passenger hatch was not too far from the bridge. Grandma found\\n it with ease, and in less than three minutes she had zipped herself\\n into one of the emergency-use space suits stowed away beside the port.\\n She felt awfully awkward climbing into the monstrous steel and plastic\\n contraption, and her small body didn't quite fit the proportions of the\\n metallic covering. But once she had maneuvered herself into it, she\\n felt quite at ease.\\n\\n\\n Opening the inner door to the airlock, she clanked into the little\\n room. As the door shut behind her, she pressed the cycling button and\\n evacuated the air from the lock.\\n\\n\\n A minute or so later she heard poundings outside the airlock and quite\\n calmly she reached out a mailed fist and turned a switch plainly\\n marked:\\nEMERGENCY LOCK\\n\\n DO NOT OPERATE IN FLIGHT\\n\\n\\n The outer hatch opened almost immediately. The radio in Grandma's suit\\n crackled with static. \\\"What are you doing here?\\\" demanded a voice over\\n the suit radio.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Pirates! I'm hiding from the pirates. They'll never find me here!\\\" she\\n told them in a voice she hoped sounded full of panic.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What's your name?\\\" asked the voice.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Darling Toujours, famous television actress,\\\" she lied quite calmly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's the one, boys,\\\" said another voice. \\\"Let's go.\\\" Catching hold\\n of Grandma's arm, they led her out into the emptiness of free space.\\nHalf an hour later, after the pirate ship had blasted far enough away\\n from the\\nKismet\\n, the men in the control room relaxed and began to\\n take off their space suits. One of the men who Grandma soon learned was\\n Lamps O'Toole, the nominal leader of the pirates, stretched his brawny\\n body to ease the crinks out of it and then rubbed his hands together.\\n Grandma noticed that he carried a week's beard on his face, as did most\\n of the other men.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, that was a good one, eh, Snake?\\\" said Lamps.\\n\\n\\n Snake Simpson was a wiry little man whose tough exterior in no way\\n suggested a reptile, except, perhaps, for his eyes which sat too close\\n to one another. \\\"You bet, Skipper. We're full fledged pirates now, just\\n like old Captain Blackbrood.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You mean Blackbeard, Snake,\\\" said Lamps.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Sure. He used to sit around broodin' up trouble all the time.\\\"\\n\\n\\n One of the other men piped up. \\\"And to think we get the pleasurable\\n company of the sweetest doll in the whole solar system for free besides\\n the money.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Aw, women are no dern good\\u2014all of them,\\\" said Snake.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Now, Snake, that's no way to talk in front of company. You just\\n apologize to the lady,\\\" Lamps told him. Lamps was six inches taller and\\n fifty pounds heavier than Snake. Snake apologized.\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's better. And now, Miss Toujours, maybe you'd be more\\n comfortable without that space suit on,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, no, thank you. I feel much better with it on,\\\" a small voice said\\n over the suit's loudspeaker system.\\n\\n\\n Lamps grinned. \\\"Oh, come now, Miss Toujours. We ain't going to hurt\\n you. I guarantee nobody will lay a finger to you.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"But I feel much\\u2014much safer, if you know what I mean,\\\" said the voice.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Heck. With one of them things on, you can't eat, can't sleep,\\n can't\\u2014Well, there's lots of things you can't do with one of them\\n things on. Besides, we all want to take a little look at you, if you\\n don't mind. Snake, you and Willie help the little lady out of her\\n attire.\\\"\\n\\n\\n As the men approached her, Grandma sensed the game was up. \\\"Okay,\\\" she\\n told them. \\\"I give up. I can make it by myself.\\\" She started to take\\n the bulky covering off. She had gotten no more than the headpiece off\\n when the truth dawned on her companions.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Holy Smoke (or something like that),\\\" said one of the men.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Nippin' Nebulae,\\\" said another.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It ain't Darling Toujours at all!\\\" cried Lamps.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It ain't even no woman!\\\" cried Snake.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I beg your pardon,\\\" said Grandma, and quite nonchalantly shed the rest\\n of the suit and sat down in a comfortable chair. \\\"I am Mrs. Matilda\\n Perkins.\\\"\\n\\n\\n When he could recover his powers of speech, Lamps sputtered, \\\"I think\\n you owe us a sort of an explanation, lady. If you know what I mean.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Certainly. I know exactly what you mean. It's all quite simple. When I\\n overheard that you intended to board the\\nKismet\\n, searching for only\\n one person, I decided that one person had to be Darling Toujours. I\\n guessed right off that she was the only one on board worth kidnapping\\n and holding for ransom, so I simply let you believe that I was she and\\n you took me. That's easy to understand, isn't it?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Lady, I don't know what your game is, but it better be good. Now, just\\n why did you do this to us?\\\" Lamps was restraining himself nobly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You never would have gotten inside the\\nKismet\\nwithout my assistance.\\n And even if you had, you'd never have gotten back out alive.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Captain Fogarty's men would have cut you to ribbons. So I opened the\\n hatch to let you in, planted myself in the way, and you got out with\\n me before they could muster their defenses. So, you see, I saved your\\n lives.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Grandma Perkins paused in her narrative and looked up at her audience,\\n giving them a withered little smile. \\\"And if you want to know why,\\n well ... I was bored on the\\nKismet\\n, and I thought how nice it would\\n be to run away and join a gang of cutthroat pirates.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"She's batty,\\\" moaned Snake.\\n\\n\\n \\\"She's lost her marbles,\\\" muttered another.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Let's toss her overboard right now,\\\" said still another.\\n\\n\\n Lamps O'Toole took the floor. \\\"Now, wait a minute. We can't do that,\\\"\\n he said loudly. \\\"We got enough trouble as is. You know what would\\n happen to us if the Space Patrol added murder to the list. They'd put\\n the whole fleet in after us and track us and our families down to the\\n last kid.\\\" Then he turned to the little old lady to explain.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Look, lady\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"My name is Mrs. Matilda Perkins. You may call me Grandma.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Okay, Grandma, look. You really fixed us good. To begin with, we ain't\\n really pirates. We used to operate this tub as a freighter between the\\n Jupiter moons. But STAR got a monopoly on all space flights, including\\n freight, and they just froze us out. We can't operate nowhere in the\\n solar system, unless we get their permission. And they just ain't\\n giving permission to nobody these days.\\\" Lamps flopped into one of the\\n control seats and lit a cigarette.\\n\\n\\n \\\"So, when us good, honest men couldn't find any work because of STAR,\\n and we didn't want to give up working in space, we just ups and decides\\n to become pirates. This was our first job, and we sure did need the\\n money we could have gotten out of Darling Toujours' studios for ransom.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Lamps sighed. \\\"Now, we got you instead, no chance of getting the ransom\\n money, and to top it all off, we'll be wanted for piracy by the Space\\n Patrol.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, it doesn't seem to me that you're ever going to be good pirates\\n at this rate,\\\" Grandma told him. \\\"You should have known better than to\\n take a woman at her word.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I don't suppose you got any rich relatives what would pay to get you\\n back?\\\" suggested Snake hopefully.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I haven't got any rich relatives period,\\\" she said pertly. Then she\\n added, \\\"But my ten children might scrape up a little cash for you if\\n you promised you wouldn't bring me back at all.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I figured as much,\\\" Lamps said dolefully. \\\"Lookit, Grandma, the best\\n thing we can do is to put you off safely at the next place we stop.\\n Unless we get you back in one piece the Space Patrol will be on our\\n necks forever. So don't go getting any ideas about joining up with us.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, the very least you could do for a poor old lady is to feed her,\\\"\\n Grandma told him, her lower lip sticking out in a most petulant manner.\\n \\\"They like to have starved me to death on that\\nKismet\\n.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"We ain't got much fancy in the line of grub....\\\" Lamps began.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Just show me the way to the kitchen,\\\" said Grandma.\\n\", \"story_title\": \"Grandma Perkins and the Space Pirates\", \"answers\": {\"correct\": \"nan\", \"incorrect\": \"One\"}, \"names\": {\"correct\": \"Debater A\", \"incorrect\": \"Debater B\", \"cross_examiner\": null, \"judge\": null}, \"swap\": false, \"rollout_type\": \"quality_sim\", \"rounds\": [{\"correct\": \"Mrs. Perkins, affectionately called Grandma, spends time only with other passengers and crew members on the Kismet.
