But given\\n the situation that neither data\\n nor time is adequate, and an\\n answer must be produced ...\\n what do you do?\\nBY JAMES BLISH\\nIllustrated by van Dongen\\n\\n\\n On the day that the Polish freighter\\nLudmilla\\nlaid an egg in New\\n York harbor, Abner Longmans\\n (\\\"One-Shot\\\") Braun was in the city\\n going about his normal business,\\n which was making another million\\n dollars. As we found out later, almost\\n nothing else was normal about\\n that particular week end for Braun.\\n For one thing, he had brought his\\n family with him\\u2014a complete departure\\n from routine\\u2014reflecting the unprecedentedly\\n legitimate nature of\\n the deals he was trying to make.\\n From every point of view it was a\\n bad week end for the CIA to mix\\n into his affairs, but nobody had explained\\n that to the master of the\\nLudmilla\\n.\\n\\n\\n I had better add here that we\\n knew nothing about this until afterward;\\n from the point of view of the\\n storyteller, an organization like Civilian\\n Intelligence Associates gets to\\n all its facts backwards, entering the\\n tale at the pay-off, working back to\\n the hook, and winding up with a\\n sheaf of background facts to feed\\n into the computer for Next Time. It's\\n rough on the various people who've\\n tried to fictionalize what we do\\u2014particularly\\n for the lazy examples of\\n the breed, who come to us expecting\\n that their plotting has already been\\n done for them\\u2014but it's inherent in\\n the way we operate, and there it is.\\n\\n\\n Certainly nobody at CIA so much\\n as thought of Braun when the news\\n first came through. Harry Anderton,\\n the Harbor Defense chief, called us\\n at 0830 Friday to take on the job of\\n identifying the egg; this was when\\n our records show us officially entering\\n the affair, but, of course, Anderton\\n had been keeping the wires to\\n Washington steaming for an hour before\\n that, getting authorization to\\n spend some of his money on us (our\\n clearance status was then and is now\\n C&amp;R\\u2014clean and routine).\\n\\n\\n I was in the central office when\\n the call came through, and had some\\n difficulty in making out precisely\\n what Anderton wanted of us. \\\"Slow\\n down, Colonel Anderton, please,\\\" I\\n begged him. \\\"Two or three seconds\\n won't make that much difference.\\n How did you find out about this egg\\n in the first place?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"The automatic compartment bulkheads\\n on the\\nLudmilla\\nwere defective,\\\"\\n he said. \\\"It seems that this\\n egg was buried among a lot of other\\n crates in the dump-cell of the\\n hold\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"What's a dump cell?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It's a sea lock for getting rid of\\n dangerous cargo. The bottom of it\\n opens right to Davy Jones. Standard\\n fitting for ships carrying explosives,\\n radioactives, anything that might act\\n up unexpectedly.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"All right,\\\" I said. \\\"Go ahead.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, there was a timer on the\\n dump-cell floor, set to drop the egg\\n when the ship came up the river.\\n That worked fine, but the automatic\\n bulkheads that are supposed to keep\\n the rest of the ship from being flooded\\n while the cell's open, didn't. At\\n least they didn't do a thorough job.\\n The\\nLudmilla\\nbegan to list and the\\n captain yelled for help. When the\\n Harbor Patrol found the dump-cell\\n open, they called us in.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I see.\\\" I thought about it a moment.\\n \\\"In other words, you don't\\n know whether the\\nLudmilla\\nreally\\n laid an egg or not.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's what I keep trying to explain\\n to you, Dr. Harris. We don't\\n know what she dropped and we\\n haven't any way of finding out. It\\n could be a bomb\\u2014it could be anything.\\n We're sweating everybody on\\n board the ship now, but it's my guess\\n that none of them know anything;\\n the whole procedure was designed to\\n be automatic.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"All right, we'll take it,\\\" I said.\\n \\\"You've got divers down?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Sure, but\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"We'll worry about the buts from\\n here on. Get us a direct line from\\n your barge to the big board here so\\n we can direct the work. Better get\\n on over here yourself.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Right.\\\" He sounded relieved.\\n Official people have a lot of confidence\\n in CIA; too much, in my estimation.\\n Some day the job will come\\n along that we can't handle, and then\\n Washington will be kicking itself\\u2014or,\\n more likely, some scapegoat\\u2014for\\n having failed to develop a comparable\\n government department.\\n\\n\\n Not that there was much prospect\\n of Washington's doing that. Official\\n thinking had been running in the\\n other direction for years. The precedent\\n was the Associated Universities\\n organization which ran Brookhaven;\\n CIA had been started the same way,\\n by a loose corporation of universities\\n and industries all of which had\\n wanted to own an ULTIMAC and\\n no one of which had had the money\\n to buy one for itself. The Eisenhower\\n administration, with its emphasis\\n on private enterprise and concomitant\\n reluctance to sink federal\\n funds into projects of such size, had\\n turned the two examples into a nice\\n fat trend, which ULTIMAC herself\\n said wasn't going to be reversed\\n within the practicable lifetime of\\n CIA.\\nI buzzed for two staffers, and in\\n five minutes got Clark Cheyney and\\n Joan Hadamard, CIA's business manager\\n and social science division chief\\n respectively. The titles were almost\\n solely for the benefit of the T/O\\u2014that\\n is, Clark and Joan do serve in\\n those capacities, but said service takes\\n about two per cent of their capacities\\n and their time. I shot them a couple\\n of sentences of explanation, trusting\\n them to pick up whatever else they\\n needed from the tape, and checked\\n the line to the divers' barge.\\n\\n\\n It was already open; Anderton had\\n gone to work quickly and with decision\\n once he was sure we were taking\\n on the major question. The television\\n screen lit, but nothing showed\\n on it but murky light, striped with\\n streamers of darkness slowly rising\\n and falling. The audio went\\ncloonck\\n...\\noing\\n,\\noing\\n...\\nbonk\\n...\\noing\\n... Underwater noises, shapeless\\n and characterless.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Hello, out there in the harbor.\\n This is CIA, Harris calling. Come in,\\n please.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Monig here,\\\" the audio said.\\nBoink\\n...\\noing\\n,\\noing\\n...\\n\\n\\n \\\"Got anything yet?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Not a thing, Dr. Harris,\\\" Monig\\n said. \\\"You can't see three inches in\\n front of your face down here\\u2014it's\\n too silty. We've bumped into a couple\\n of crates, but so far, no egg.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Keep trying.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Cheyney, looking even more like\\n a bulldog than usual, was setting his\\n stopwatch by one of the eight clocks\\n on ULTIMAC's face. \\\"Want me to\\n take the divers?\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \\\"No, Clark, not yet. I'd rather\\n have Joan do it for the moment.\\\" I\\n passed the mike to her. \\\"You'd better\\n run a probability series first.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Check.\\\" He began feeding tape\\n into the integrator's mouth. \\\"What's\\n your angle, Peter?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"The ship. I want to see how heavily\\n shielded that dump-cell is.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It isn't shielded at all,\\\" Anderton's\\n voice said behind me. I hadn't\\n heard him come in. \\\"But that doesn't\\n prove anything. The egg might have\\n carried sufficient shielding in itself.\\n Or maybe the Commies didn't care\\n whether the crew was exposed or not.\\n Or maybe there isn't any egg.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"All that's possible,\\\" I admitted.\\n \\\"But I want to see it, anyhow.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Have you taken blood tests?\\\"\\n Joan asked Anderton.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Get the reports through to me,\\n then. I want white-cell counts, differentials,\\n platelet counts, hematocrit\\n and sed rates on every man.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Anderton picked up the phone and\\n I took a firm hold on the doorknob.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Hey,\\\" Anderton said, putting the\\n phone down again. \\\"Are you going\\n to duck out just like that? Remember,\\n Dr. Harris, we've got to evacuate the\\n city first of all! No matter whether\\n it's a real egg or not\\u2014we can't take\\n the chance on it's\\nnot\\nbeing an egg!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Don't move a man until you get\\n a go-ahead from CIA,\\\" I said. \\\"For\\n all we know now, evacuating the city\\n may be just what the enemy wants us\\n to do\\u2014so they can grab it unharmed.\\n Or they may want to start a panic\\n for some other reason, any one of\\n fifty possible reasons.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You can't take such a gamble,\\\"\\n he said grimly. \\\"There are eight and\\n a half million lives riding on it. I\\n can't let you do it.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You passed your authority to us\\n when you hired us,\\\" I pointed out.\\n \\\"If you want to evacuate without our\\n O.K., you'll have to fire us first. It'll\\n take another hour to get that cleared\\n from Washington\\u2014so you might as\\n well give us the hour.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He stared at me for a moment, his\\n lips thinned. Then he picked up the\\n phone again to order Joan's blood\\n count, and I got out the door, fast.\\nA reasonable man would have said\\n that I found nothing useful on the\\nLudmilla\\n, except negative information.\\n But the fact is that anything I\\n found would have been a surprise to\\n me; I went down looking for surprises.\\n I found nothing but a faint\\n trail to Abner Longmans Braun, most\\n of which was fifteen years cold.\\n\\n\\n There'd been a time when I'd\\n known Braun, briefly and to no\\n profit to either of us. As an undergraduate\\n majoring in social sciences,\\n I'd taken on a term paper on the old\\n International Longshoreman's Association,\\n a racket-ridden union now\\n formally extinct\\u2014although anyone\\n who knew the signs could still pick\\n up some traces on the docks. In those\\n days, Braun had been the business\\n manager of an insurance firm, the\\n sole visible function of which had\\n been to write policies for the ILA\\n and its individual dock-wallopers.\\n For some reason, he had been amused\\n by the brash youngster who'd barged\\n in on him and demanded the lowdown,\\n and had shown me considerable\\n lengths of ropes not normally\\n in view of the public\\u2014nothing incriminating,\\n but enough to give me\\n a better insight into how the union\\n operated than I had had any right to\\n expect\\u2014or even suspect.\\n\\n\\n Hence I was surprised to hear\\n somebody on the docks remark that\\n Braun was in the city over the week\\n end. It would never have occurred\\n to me that he still interested himself\\n in the waterfront, for he'd gone respectable\\n with a vengeance. He was\\n still a professional gambler, and according\\n to what he had told the\\n Congressional Investigating Committee\\n last year, took in thirty to fifty\\n thousand dollars a year at it, but his\\n gambles were no longer concentrated\\n on horses, the numbers, or shady insurance\\n deals. Nowadays what he did\\n was called investment\\u2014mostly in real\\n estate; realtors knew him well as the\\n man who had\\nalmost\\nbought the Empire\\n State Building. (The\\nalmost\\nin\\n the equation stands for the moment\\n when the shoestring broke.)\\n\\n\\n Joan had been following his career,\\n too, not because she had ever met\\n him, but because for her he was a\\n type study in the evolution of what\\n she called \\\"the extra-legal ego.\\\"\\n \\\"With personalities like that, respectability\\n is a disease,\\\" she told me.\\n \\\"There's always an almost-open conflict\\n between the desire to be powerful\\n and the desire to be accepted;\\n your ordinary criminal is a moral imbecile,\\n but people like Braun are\\n damned with a conscience, and sooner\\n or later they crack trying to appease\\n it.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'd sooner try to crack a Timkin\\n bearing,\\\" I said. \\\"Braun's ten-point\\n steel all the way through.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Don't you believe it. The symptoms\\n are showing all over him. Now\\n he's backing Broadway plays, sponsoring\\n beginning actresses, joining\\n playwrights' groups\\u2014he's the only\\n member of Buskin and Brush who's\\n never written a play, acted in one, or\\n so much as pulled the rope to raise\\n the curtain.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's investment,\\\" I said.\\n \\\"That's his business.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Peter, you're only looking at the\\n surface. His real investments almost\\n never fail. But the plays he backs\\nalways\\ndo. They have to; he's sinking\\n money in them to appease his conscience,\\n and if they were to succeed it\\n would double his guilt instead of\\n salving it. It's the same way with the\\n young actresses. He's not sexually\\n interested in them\\u2014his type never is,\\n because living a rigidly orthodox\\n family life is part of the effort towards\\n respectability. He's backing\\n them to 'pay his debt to society'\\u2014in\\n other words, they're talismans to\\n keep him out of jail.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It doesn't seem like a very satisfactory\\n substitute.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Of course it isn't,\\\" Joan had said.\\n \\\"The next thing he'll do is go in for\\n direct public service\\u2014giving money\\n to hospitals or something like that.\\n You watch.\\\"\\n\\n\\n She had been right; within the\\n year, Braun had announced the\\n founding of an association for clearing\\n the Detroit slum area where he\\n had been born\\u2014the plainest kind of\\n symbolic suicide:\\nLet's not have any\\n more Abner Longmans Brauns born\\n down here\\n. It depressed me to see it\\n happen, for next on Joan's agenda\\n for Braun was an entry into politics\\n as a fighting liberal\\u2014a New Dealer\\n twenty years too late. Since I'm mildly\\n liberal myself when I'm off duty,\\n I hated to think what Braun's career\\n might tell me about my own motives,\\n if I'd let it.\\nAll of which had nothing to do\\n with why I was prowling around the\\nLudmilla\\n\\u2014or did it? I kept remembering\\n Anderton's challenge: \\\"You\\n can't take such a gamble. There are\\n eight and a half million lives riding\\n on it\\u2014\\\" That put it up into Braun's\\n normal operating area, all right. The\\n connection was still hazy, but on the\\n grounds that any link might be useful,\\n I phoned him.\\n\\n\\n He remembered me instantly; like\\n most uneducated, power-driven men,\\n he had a memory as good as any machine's.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You never did send me that paper\\n you was going to write,\\\" he said. His\\n voice seemed absolutely unchanged,\\n although he was in his seventies now.\\n \\\"You promised you would.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Kids don't keep their promises\\n as well as they should,\\\" I said. \\\"But\\n I've still got copies and I'll see to it\\n that you get one, this time. Right\\n now I need another favor\\u2014something\\n right up your alley.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"CIA business?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes. I didn't know you knew I\\n was with CIA.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Braun chuckled. \\\"I still know a\\n thing or two,\\\" he said. \\\"What's the\\n angle?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"That I can't tell you over the\\n phone. But it's the biggest gamble\\n there ever was, and I think we need\\n an expert. Can you come down to\\n CIA's central headquarters right\\n away?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yeah, if it's that big. If it ain't,\\n I got lots of business here, Andy.\\n And I ain't going to be in town long.\\n You're sure it's top stuff?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"My word on it.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He was silent a moment. Then he\\n said, \\\"Andy, send me your paper.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"The paper? Sure, but\\u2014\\\" Then I\\n got it. I'd given him my word.\\n \\\"You'll get it,\\\" I said. \\\"Thanks, Mr.\\n Braun.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I called headquarters and sent a\\n messenger to my apartment to look\\n for one of those long-dusty blue folders\\n with the legal-length sheets inside\\n them, with orders to scorch it over\\n to Braun without stopping to breathe\\n more than once. Then I went back\\n myself.\\n\\n\\n The atmosphere had changed. Anderton\\n was sitting by the big desk,\\n clenching his fists and sweating; his\\n whole posture telegraphed his controlled\\n helplessness. Cheyney was\\n bent over a seismograph, echo-sounding\\n for the egg through the river\\n bottom. If that even had a prayer of\\n working, I knew, he'd have had the\\n trains of the Hudson &amp; Manhattan\\n stopped; their rumbling course\\n through their tubes would have\\n blanked out any possible echo-pip\\n from the egg.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Wild goose chase?\\\" Joan said,\\n scanning my face.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Not quite. I've got something, if\\n I can just figure out what it is. Remember\\n One-Shot Braun?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes. What's he got to do with\\n it?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Nothing,\\\" I said. \\\"But I want\\n to bring him in. I don't think we'll\\n lick this project before deadline without\\n him.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"What good is a professional\\n gambler on a job like this? He'll just\\n get in the way.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I looked toward the television\\n screen, which now showed an\\n amorphous black mass, jutting up\\n from a foundation of even deeper\\n black. \\\"Is that operation getting you\\n anywhere?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Nothing's gotten us anywhere,\\\"\\n Anderton interjected harshly. \\\"We\\n don't even know if that's the egg\\u2014the\\n whole area is littered with crates.\\n Harris, you've got to let me get that\\n alert out!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Clark, how's the time going?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Cheyney consulted the stopwatch.\\n \\\"Deadline in twenty-nine minutes,\\\"\\n he said.\\n\\n\\n \\\"All right, let's use those minutes.\\n I'm beginning to see this thing\\n a little clearer. Joan, what we've got\\n here is a one-shot gamble; right?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"In effect,\\\" she said cautiously.\\n\\n\\n \\\"And it's my guess that we're\\n never going to get the answer by\\n diving for it\\u2014not in time, anyhow.\\n Remember when the Navy lost a\\n barge-load of shells in the harbor,\\n back in '52? They scrabbled for them\\n for a year and never pulled up a one;\\n they finally had to warn the public\\n that if it found anything funny-looking\\n along the shore it shouldn't bang\\n said object, or shake it either. We're\\n better equipped than the Navy was\\n then\\u2014but we're working against a\\n deadline.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"If you'd admitted that earlier,\\\"\\n Anderton said hoarsely, \\\"we'd have\\n half a million people out of the city\\n by now. Maybe even a million.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"We haven't given up yet, colonel.\\n The point is this, Joan: what\\n we need is an inspired guess. Get\\n anything from the prob series, Clark?\\n I thought not. On a one-shot gamble\\n of this kind, the 'laws' of chance are\\n no good at all. For that matter, the\\n so-called ESP experiments showed us\\n long ago that even the way we construct\\n random tables is full of holes\\u2014and\\n that a man with a feeling for\\n the essence of a gamble can make a\\n monkey out of chance almost at will.\\n\\n\\n \\\"And if there ever was such a\\n man, Braun is it. That's why I asked\\n him to come down here. I want him\\n to look at that lump on the screen\\n and\\u2014play a hunch.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You're out of your mind,\\\" Anderton\\n said.\\nA decorous knock spared me the\\n trouble of having to deny, affirm or\\n ignore the judgment. It was Braun;\\n the messenger had been fast, and\\n the gambler hadn't bothered to read\\n what a college student had thought\\n of him fifteen years ago. He came\\n forward and held out his hand, while\\n the others looked him over frankly.\\n\\n\\n He was impressive, all right. It\\n would have been hard for a stranger\\n to believe that he was aiming at respectability;\\n to the eye, he was already\\n there. He was tall and spare,\\n and walked perfectly erect, not without\\n spring despite his age. His clothing\\n was as far from that of a\\n gambler as you could have taken it\\n by design: a black double-breasted\\n suit with a thin vertical stripe, a gray\\n silk tie with a pearl stickpin just\\n barely large enough to be visible at\\n all, a black Homburg; all perfectly\\n fitted, all worn with proper casualness\\u2014one\\n might almost say a formal\\n casualness. It was only when he\\n opened his mouth that One-Shot\\n Braun was in the suit with him.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I come over as soon as your runner\\n got to me,\\\" he said. \\\"What's the\\n pitch, Andy?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Mr. Braun, this is Joan Hadamard,\\n Clark Cheyney, Colonel Anderton.\\n I'll be quick because we need\\n speed now. A Polish ship has dropped\\n something out in the harbor.\\n We don't know what it is. It may be\\n a hell-bomb, or it may be just somebody's\\n old laundry. Obviously we've\\n got to find out which\\u2014and we want\\n you to tell us.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Braun's aristocratic eyebrows went\\n up. \\\"Me? Hell, Andy, I don't know\\n nothing about things like that. I'm\\n surprised with you. I thought CIA\\n had all the brains it needed\\u2014ain't\\n you got machines to tell you answers\\n like that?\\\"\\n\\n\\n I pointed silently to Joan, who had\\n gone back to work the moment the\\n introductions were over. She was still\\n on the mike to the divers. She was\\n saying: \\\"What does it look like?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It's just a lump of something,\\n Dr. Hadamard. Can't even tell its\\n shape\\u2014it's buried too deeply in the\\n mud.\\\"\\nCloonk\\n...\\nOing\\n,\\noing\\n...\\n\\n\\n \\\"Try the Geiger.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"We did.

Could\\n be it's shielded.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Let us do the guessing, Monig.\\n All right, maybe it's got a clockwork\\n fuse that didn't break with the impact.\\n Or a gyroscopic fuse. Stick a\\n stethoscope on it and see if you pick\\n up a ticking or anything that sounds\\n like a motor running.\\\"\\nThere was a lag and I turned back\\n to Braun. \\\"As you can see, we're\\n stymied. This is a long shot, Mr.\\n Braun. One throw of the dice\\u2014one\\n show-down hand. We've got to have\\n an expert call it for us\\u2014somebody\\n with a record of hits on long shots.\\n That's why I called you.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It's no good,\\\" he said. He took\\n off the Homburg, took his handkerchief\\n from his breast pocket, and\\n wiped the hatband. \\\"I can't do it.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Why not?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It ain't my\\nkind\\nof thing,\\\" he\\n said. \\\"Look, I never in my life run\\n odds on anything that made any difference.\\n But this makes a difference.\\n If I guess wrong\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Then we're all dead ducks. But\\n why should you guess wrong? Your\\n hunches have been working for sixty\\n years now.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Braun wiped his face. \\\"No. You\\n don't get it. I wish you'd listen to\\n me. Look, my wife and my kids are\\n in the city. It ain't only my life, it's\\n theirs, too. That's what I care about.\\n That's why it's no good. On things\\n that matter to me,\\nmy hunches don't\\n work\\n.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I was stunned, and so, I could see,\\n were Joan and Cheyney. I suppose I\\n should have guessed it, but it had\\n never occurred to me.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ten minutes,\\\" Cheyney said.\\n\\n\\n I looked up at Braun. He was\\n frightened, and again I was surprised\\n without having any right to\\n be. I tried to keep at least my voice\\n calm.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Please try it anyhow, Mr. Braun\\u2014as\\n a favor. It's already too late to\\n do it any other way. And if you guess\\n wrong, the outcome won't be any\\n worse than if you don't try at all.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"My kids,\\\" he whispered. I don't\\n think he knew that he was speaking\\n aloud. I waited.\\n\\n\\n Then his eyes seemed to come back\\n to the present. \\\"All right,\\\" he said.\\n \\\"I told you the truth, Andy. Remember\\n that. So\\u2014is it a bomb or ain't it?\\n That's what's up for grabs, right?\\\"\\n\\n\\n I nodded. He closed his eyes. An\\n unexpected stab of pure fright went\\n down my back. Without the eyes,\\n Braun's face was a death mask.\\n\\n\\n The water sounds and the irregular\\n ticking of a Geiger counter\\n seemed to spring out from the audio\\n speaker, four times as loud as before.\\n I could even hear the pen of\\n the seismograph scribbling away, until\\n I looked at the instrument and\\n saw that Clark had stopped it, probably\\n long ago.\\n\\n\\n Droplets of sweat began to form\\n along Braun's forehead and his upper\\n lip. The handkerchief remained\\n crushed in his hand.\\n\\n\\n Anderton said, \\\"Of all the fool\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Hush!\\\" Joan said quietly.\\nSlowly, Braun opened his eyes.\\n \\\"All right,\\\" he said. \\\"You guys\\n wanted it this way.\\nI say it's a bomb.\\n\\\"\\n He stared at us for a moment more\\u2014and\\n then, all at once, the Timkin\\n bearing burst. Words poured out of\\n it. \\\"Now you guys do something, do\\n your job like I did mine\\u2014get my\\n wife and kids out of there\\u2014empty\\n the city\\u2014do something,\\ndo something\\n!\\\"\\n\\n\\n Anderton was already grabbing\\n for the phone. \\\"You're right, Mr.\\n Braun. If it isn't already too late\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n Cheyney shot out a hand and\\n caught Anderton's telephone arm by\\n the wrist. \\\"Wait a minute,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What d'you mean, 'wait a minute'?\\n Haven't you already shot\\n enough time?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Cheyney did not let go; instead,\\n he looked inquiringly at Joan and\\n said, \\\"One minute, Joan. You might\\n as well go ahead.\\\"\\n\\n\\n She nodded and spoke into the\\n mike. \\\"Monig, unscrew the cap.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Unscrew the cap?\\\" the audio\\n squawked. \\\"But Dr. Hadamard, if\\n that sets it off\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It won't go off. That's the one\\n thing you can be sure it won't do.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"What is this?\\\" Anderton demanded.\\n \\\"And what's this deadline\\n stuff, anyhow?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"The cap's off,\\\" Monig reported.\\n \\\"We're getting plenty of radiation\\n now. Just a minute\\u2014 Yeah. Dr.\\n Hadamard, it's a bomb, all right.\\n But it hasn't got a fuse. Now how\\n could they have made a fool mistake\\n like that?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"In other words, it's a dud,\\\" Joan\\n said.\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's right, a dud.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Now, at last, Braun wiped his face,\\n which was quite gray. \\\"I told you\\n the truth,\\\" he said grimly. \\\"My\\n hunches don't work on stuff like\\n this.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"But they do,\\\" I said. \\\"I'm sorry\\n we put you through the wringer\\u2014and\\n you too, colonel\\u2014but we couldn't\\n let an opportunity like this slip.\\n It was too good a chance for us to\\n test how our facilities would stand\\n up in a real bomb-drop.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"A real drop?\\\" Anderton said.\\n \\\"Are you trying to say that CIA\\n staged this? You ought to be shot,\\n the whole pack of you!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"No, not exactly,\\\" I said. \\\"The\\n enemy's responsible for the drop, all\\n right. We got word last month from\\n our man in Gdynia that they were\\n going to do it, and that the bomb\\n would be on board the\\nLudmilla\\n. As\\n I say, it was too good an opportunity\\n to miss. We wanted to find out just\\n how long it would take us to figure\\n out the nature of the bomb\\u2014which\\n we didn't know in detail\\u2014after it\\n was dropped here. So we had our\\n people in Gdynia defuse the thing\\n after it was put on board the ship,\\n but otherwise leave it entirely alone.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Actually, you see, your hunch was\\n right on the button as far as it went.\\n We didn't ask you whether or not\\n that object was a live bomb. We\\n asked whether it was a bomb or not.\\n You said it was, and you were right.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The expression on Braun's face\\n was exactly like the one he had worn\\n while he had been searching for his\\n decision\\u2014except that, since his eyes\\n were open, I could see that it was\\n directed at me. \\\"If this was the old\\n days,\\\" he said in an ice-cold voice,\\n \\\"I might of made the colonel's idea\\n come true. I don't go for tricks like\\n this, Andy.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It was more than a trick,\\\" Clark\\n put in. \\\"You'll remember we had\\n a deadline on the test, Mr. Braun.\\n Obviously, in a real drop we wouldn't\\n have all the time in the world\\n to figure out what kind of a thing\\n had been dropped. If we had still\\n failed to establish that when the\\n deadline ran out, we would have\\n had to allow evacuation of the city,\\n with all the attendant risk that that\\n was exactly what the enemy wanted\\n us to do.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"So?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"So we failed the test,\\\" I said. \\\"At\\n one minute short of the deadline,\\n Joan had the divers unscrew the cap.\\n In a real drop that would have resulted\\n in a detonation, if the bomb\\n was real; we'd never risk it. That\\n we did do it in the test was a concession\\n of failure\\u2014an admission that\\n our usual methods didn't come\\n through for us in time.\\n\\n\\n \\\"And that means that you were\\n the only person who did come\\n through, Mr. Braun. If a real bomb-drop\\n ever comes, we're going to have\\n to have you here, as an active part of\\n our investigation. Your intuition for\\n the one-shot gamble was the one\\n thing that bailed us out this time.\\n Next time it may save eight million\\n lives.\\\"\\n\\n\\n There was quite a long silence. All\\n of us, Anderton included, watched\\n Braun intently, but his impassive\\n face failed to show any trace of how\\n his thoughts were running.\\n\\n\\n When he did speak at last, what\\n he said must have seemed insanely\\n irrelevant to Anderton, and maybe\\n to Cheyney too. And perhaps it\\n meant nothing more to Joan than\\n the final clinical note in a case history.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It's funny,\\\" he said, \\\"I was\\n thinking of running for Congress\\n next year from my district.

But given\\n the situation that neither data\\n nor time is adequate, and an\\n answer must be produced ...\\n what do you do?\\nBY JAMES BLISH\\nIllustrated by van Dongen\\n\\n\\n On the day that the Polish freighter\\nLudmilla\\nlaid an egg in New\\n York harbor, Abner Longmans\\n (\\\"One-Shot\\\") Braun was in the city\\n going about his normal business,\\n which was making another million\\n dollars. As we found out later, almost\\n nothing else was normal about\\n that particular week end for Braun.\\n For one thing, he had brought his\\n family with him\\u2014a complete departure\\n from routine\\u2014reflecting the unprecedentedly\\n legitimate nature of\\n the deals he was trying to make.\\n From every point of view it was a\\n bad week end for the CIA to mix\\n into his affairs, but nobody had explained\\n that to the master of the\\nLudmilla\\n.\\n\\n\\n I had better add here that we\\n knew nothing about this until afterward;\\n from the point of view of the\\n storyteller, an organization like Civilian\\n Intelligence Associates gets to\\n all its facts backwards, entering the\\n tale at the pay-off, working back to\\n the hook, and winding up with a\\n sheaf of background facts to feed\\n into the computer for Next Time. It's\\n rough on the various people who've\\n tried to fictionalize what we do\\u2014particularly\\n for the lazy examples of\\n the breed, who come to us expecting\\n that their plotting has already been\\n done for them\\u2014but it's inherent in\\n the way we operate, and there it is.\\n\\n\\n Certainly nobody at CIA so much\\n as thought of Braun when the news\\n first came through. Harry Anderton,\\n the Harbor Defense chief, called us\\n at 0830 Friday to take on the job of\\n identifying the egg; this was when\\n our records show us officially entering\\n the affair, but, of course, Anderton\\n had been keeping the wires to\\n Washington steaming for an hour before\\n that, getting authorization to\\n spend some of his money on us (our\\n clearance status was then and is now\\n C&amp;R\\u2014clean and routine).\\n\\n\\n I was in the central office when\\n the call came through, and had some\\n difficulty in making out precisely\\n what Anderton wanted of us. \\\"Slow\\n down, Colonel Anderton, please,\\\" I\\n begged him. \\\"Two or three seconds\\n won't make that much difference.\\n How did you find out about this egg\\n in the first place?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"The automatic compartment bulkheads\\n on the\\nLudmilla\\nwere defective,\\\"\\n he said. \\\"It seems that this\\n egg was buried among a lot of other\\n crates in the dump-cell of the\\n hold\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"What's a dump cell?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It's a sea lock for getting rid of\\n dangerous cargo. The bottom of it\\n opens right to Davy Jones. Standard\\n fitting for ships carrying explosives,\\n radioactives, anything that might act\\n up unexpectedly.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"All right,\\\" I said. \\\"Go ahead.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, there was a timer on the\\n dump-cell floor, set to drop the egg\\n when the ship came up the river.\\n That worked fine, but the automatic\\n bulkheads that are supposed to keep\\n the rest of the ship from being flooded\\n while the cell's open, didn't. At\\n least they didn't do a thorough job.\\n The\\nLudmilla\\nbegan to list and the\\n captain yelled for help. When the\\n Harbor Patrol found the dump-cell\\n open, they called us in.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I see.\\\" I thought about it a moment.\\n \\\"In other words, you don't\\n know whether the\\nLudmilla\\nreally\\n laid an egg or not.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's what I keep trying to explain\\n to you, Dr. Harris. We don't\\n know what she dropped and we\\n haven't any way of finding out. It\\n could be a bomb\\u2014it could be anything.\\n We're sweating everybody on\\n board the ship now, but it's my guess\\n that none of them know anything;\\n the whole procedure was designed to\\n be automatic.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"All right, we'll take it,\\\" I said.\\n \\\"You've got divers down?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Sure, but\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"We'll worry about the buts from\\n here on. Get us a direct line from\\n your barge to the big board here so\\n we can direct the work. Better get\\n on over here yourself.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Right.\\\" He sounded relieved.\\n Official people have a lot of confidence\\n in CIA; too much, in my estimation.\\n Some day the job will come\\n along that we can't handle, and then\\n Washington will be kicking itself\\u2014or,\\n more likely, some scapegoat\\u2014for\\n having failed to develop a comparable\\n government department.\\n\\n\\n Not that there was much prospect\\n of Washington's doing that. Official\\n thinking had been running in the\\n other direction for years. The precedent\\n was the Associated Universities\\n organization which ran Brookhaven;\\n CIA had been started the same way,\\n by a loose corporation of universities\\n and industries all of which had\\n wanted to own an ULTIMAC and\\n no one of which had had the money\\n to buy one for itself. The Eisenhower\\n administration, with its emphasis\\n on private enterprise and concomitant\\n reluctance to sink federal\\n funds into projects of such size, had\\n turned the two examples into a nice\\n fat trend, which ULTIMAC herself\\n said wasn't going to be reversed\\n within the practicable lifetime of\\n CIA.\\nI buzzed for two staffers, and in\\n five minutes got Clark Cheyney and\\n Joan Hadamard, CIA's business manager\\n and social science division chief\\n respectively. The titles were almost\\n solely for the benefit of the T/O\\u2014that\\n is, Clark and Joan do serve in\\n those capacities, but said service takes\\n about two per cent of their capacities\\n and their time. I shot them a couple\\n of sentences of explanation, trusting\\n them to pick up whatever else they\\n needed from the tape, and checked\\n the line to the divers' barge.\\n\\n\\n It was already open; Anderton had\\n gone to work quickly and with decision\\n once he was sure we were taking\\n on the major question. The television\\n screen lit, but nothing showed\\n on it but murky light, striped with\\n streamers of darkness slowly rising\\n and falling. The audio went\\ncloonck\\n...\\noing\\n,\\noing\\n...\\nbonk\\n...\\noing\\n... Underwater noises, shapeless\\n and characterless.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Hello, out there in the harbor.\\n This is CIA, Harris calling. Come in,\\n please.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Monig here,\\\" the audio said.\\nBoink\\n...\\noing\\n,\\noing\\n...\\n\\n\\n \\\"Got anything yet?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Not a thing, Dr. Harris,\\\" Monig\\n said. \\\"You can't see three inches in\\n front of your face down here\\u2014it's\\n too silty. We've bumped into a couple\\n of crates, but so far, no egg.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Keep trying.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Cheyney, looking even more like\\n a bulldog than usual, was setting his\\n stopwatch by one of the eight clocks\\n on ULTIMAC's face. \\\"Want me to\\n take the divers?\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \\\"No, Clark, not yet. I'd rather\\n have Joan do it for the moment.\\\" I\\n passed the mike to her. \\\"You'd better\\n run a probability series first.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Check.\\\" He began feeding tape\\n into the integrator's mouth. \\\"What's\\n your angle, Peter?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"The ship. I want to see how heavily\\n shielded that dump-cell is.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It isn't shielded at all,\\\" Anderton's\\n voice said behind me. I hadn't\\n heard him come in. \\\"But that doesn't\\n prove anything. The egg might have\\n carried sufficient shielding in itself.\\n Or maybe the Commies didn't care\\n whether the crew was exposed or not.\\n Or maybe there isn't any egg.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"All that's possible,\\\" I admitted.\\n \\\"But I want to see it, anyhow.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Have you taken blood tests?\\\"\\n Joan asked Anderton.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Get the reports through to me,\\n then. I want white-cell counts, differentials,\\n platelet counts, hematocrit\\n and sed rates on every man.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Anderton picked up the phone and\\n I took a firm hold on the doorknob.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Hey,\\\" Anderton said, putting the\\n phone down again. \\\"Are you going\\n to duck out just like that? Remember,\\n Dr. Harris, we've got to evacuate the\\n city first of all! No matter whether\\n it's a real egg or not\\u2014we can't take\\n the chance on it's\\nnot\\nbeing an egg!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Don't move a man until you get\\n a go-ahead from CIA,\\\" I said. \\\"For\\n all we know now, evacuating the city\\n may be just what the enemy wants us\\n to do\\u2014so they can grab it unharmed.\\n Or they may want to start a panic\\n for some other reason, any one of\\n fifty possible reasons.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You can't take such a gamble,\\\"\\n he said grimly. \\\"There are eight and\\n a half million lives riding on it. I\\n can't let you do it.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You passed your authority to us\\n when you hired us,\\\" I pointed out.\\n \\\"If you want to evacuate without our\\n O.K., you'll have to fire us first. It'll\\n take another hour to get that cleared\\n from Washington\\u2014so you might as\\n well give us the hour.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He stared at me for a moment, his\\n lips thinned. Then he picked up the\\n phone again to order Joan's blood\\n count, and I got out the door, fast.\\nA reasonable man would have said\\n that I found nothing useful on the\\nLudmilla\\n, except negative information.\\n But the fact is that anything I\\n found would have been a surprise to\\n me; I went down looking for surprises.\\n I found nothing but a faint\\n trail to Abner Longmans Braun, most\\n of which was fifteen years cold.\\n\\n\\n There'd been a time when I'd\\n known Braun, briefly and to no\\n profit to either of us. As an undergraduate\\n majoring in social sciences,\\n I'd taken on a term paper on the old\\n International Longshoreman's Association,\\n a racket-ridden union now\\n formally extinct\\u2014although anyone\\n who knew the signs could still pick\\n up some traces on the docks. In those\\n days, Braun had been the business\\n manager of an insurance firm, the\\n sole visible function of which had\\n been to write policies for the ILA\\n and its individual dock-wallopers.\\n For some reason, he had been amused\\n by the brash youngster who'd barged\\n in on him and demanded the lowdown,\\n and had shown me considerable\\n lengths of ropes not normally\\n in view of the public\\u2014nothing incriminating,\\n but enough to give me\\n a better insight into how the union\\n operated than I had had any right to\\n expect\\u2014or even suspect.\\n\\n\\n Hence I was surprised to hear\\n somebody on the docks remark that\\n Braun was in the city over the week\\n end. It would never have occurred\\n to me that he still interested himself\\n in the waterfront, for he'd gone respectable\\n with a vengeance. He was\\n still a professional gambler, and according\\n to what he had told the\\n Congressional Investigating Committee\\n last year, took in thirty to fifty\\n thousand dollars a year at it, but his\\n gambles were no longer concentrated\\n on horses, the numbers, or shady insurance\\n deals. Nowadays what he did\\n was called investment\\u2014mostly in real\\n estate; realtors knew him well as the\\n man who had\\nalmost\\nbought the Empire\\n State Building. (The\\nalmost\\nin\\n the equation stands for the moment\\n when the shoestring broke.)\\n\\n\\n Joan had been following his career,\\n too, not because she had ever met\\n him, but because for her he was a\\n type study in the evolution of what\\n she called \\\"the extra-legal ego.\\\"\\n \\\"With personalities like that, respectability\\n is a disease,\\\" she told me.\\n \\\"There's always an almost-open conflict\\n between the desire to be powerful\\n and the desire to be accepted;\\n your ordinary criminal is a moral imbecile,\\n but people like Braun are\\n damned with a conscience, and sooner\\n or later they crack trying to appease\\n it.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'd sooner try to crack a Timkin\\n bearing,\\\" I said. \\\"Braun's ten-point\\n steel all the way through.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Don't you believe it. The symptoms\\n are showing all over him. Now\\n he's backing Broadway plays, sponsoring\\n beginning actresses, joining\\n playwrights' groups\\u2014he's the only\\n member of Buskin and Brush who's\\n never written a play, acted in one, or\\n so much as pulled the rope to raise\\n the curtain.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's investment,\\\" I said.\\n \\\"That's his business.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Peter, you're only looking at the\\n surface. His real investments almost\\n never fail. But the plays he backs\\nalways\\ndo. They have to; he's sinking\\n money in them to appease his conscience,\\n and if they were to succeed it\\n would double his guilt instead of\\n salving it. It's the same way with the\\n young actresses. He's not sexually\\n interested in them\\u2014his type never is,\\n because living a rigidly orthodox\\n family life is part of the effort towards\\n respectability. He's backing\\n them to 'pay his debt to society'\\u2014in\\n other words, they're talismans to\\n keep him out of jail.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It doesn't seem like a very satisfactory\\n substitute.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Of course it isn't,\\\" Joan had said.\\n \\\"The next thing he'll do is go in for\\n direct public service\\u2014giving money\\n to hospitals or something like that.\\n You watch.\\\"\\n\\n\\n She had been right; within the\\n year, Braun had announced the\\n founding of an association for clearing\\n the Detroit slum area where he\\n had been born\\u2014the plainest kind of\\n symbolic suicide:\\nLet's not have any\\n more Abner Longmans Brauns born\\n down here\\n. It depressed me to see it\\n happen, for next on Joan's agenda\\n for Braun was an entry into politics\\n as a fighting liberal\\u2014a New Dealer\\n twenty years too late. Since I'm mildly\\n liberal myself when I'm off duty,\\n I hated to think what Braun's career\\n might tell me about my own motives,\\n if I'd let it.\\nAll of which had nothing to do\\n with why I was prowling around the\\nLudmilla\\n\\u2014or did it? I kept remembering\\n Anderton's challenge: \\\"You\\n can't take such a gamble. There are\\n eight and a half million lives riding\\n on it\\u2014\\\" That put it up into Braun's\\n normal operating area, all right. The\\n connection was still hazy, but on the\\n grounds that any link might be useful,\\n I phoned him.\\n\\n\\n He remembered me instantly; like\\n most uneducated, power-driven men,\\n he had a memory as good as any machine's.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You never did send me that paper\\n you was going to write,\\\" he said. His\\n voice seemed absolutely unchanged,\\n although he was in his seventies now.\\n \\\"You promised you would.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Kids don't keep their promises\\n as well as they should,\\\" I said. \\\"But\\n I've still got copies and I'll see to it\\n that you get one, this time. Right\\n now I need another favor\\u2014something\\n right up your alley.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"CIA business?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes. I didn't know you knew I\\n was with CIA.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Braun chuckled. \\\"I still know a\\n thing or two,\\\" he said. \\\"What's the\\n angle?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"That I can't tell you over the\\n phone. But it's the biggest gamble\\n there ever was, and I think we need\\n an expert. Can you come down to\\n CIA's central headquarters right\\n away?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yeah, if it's that big. If it ain't,\\n I got lots of business here, Andy.\\n And I ain't going to be in town long.\\n You're sure it's top stuff?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"My word on it.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He was silent a moment. Then he\\n said, \\\"Andy, send me your paper.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"The paper? Sure, but\\u2014\\\" Then I\\n got it. I'd given him my word.\\n \\\"You'll get it,\\\" I said. \\\"Thanks, Mr.\\n Braun.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I called headquarters and sent a\\n messenger to my apartment to look\\n for one of those long-dusty blue folders\\n with the legal-length sheets inside\\n them, with orders to scorch it over\\n to Braun without stopping to breathe\\n more than once. Then I went back\\n myself.\\n\\n\\n The atmosphere had changed. Anderton\\n was sitting by the big desk,\\n clenching his fists and sweating; his\\n whole posture telegraphed his controlled\\n helplessness. Cheyney was\\n bent over a seismograph, echo-sounding\\n for the egg through the river\\n bottom. If that even had a prayer of\\n working, I knew, he'd have had the\\n trains of the Hudson &amp; Manhattan\\n stopped; their rumbling course\\n through their tubes would have\\n blanked out any possible echo-pip\\n from the egg.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Wild goose chase?\\\" Joan said,\\n scanning my face.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Not quite. I've got something, if\\n I can just figure out what it is. Remember\\n One-Shot Braun?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes. What's he got to do with\\n it?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Nothing,\\\" I said. \\\"But I want\\n to bring him in. I don't think we'll\\n lick this project before deadline without\\n him.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"What good is a professional\\n gambler on a job like this? He'll just\\n get in the way.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I looked toward the television\\n screen, which now showed an\\n amorphous black mass, jutting up\\n from a foundation of even deeper\\n black. \\\"Is that operation getting you\\n anywhere?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Nothing's gotten us anywhere,\\\"\\n Anderton interjected harshly. \\\"We\\n don't even know if that's the egg\\u2014the\\n whole area is littered with crates.\\n Harris, you've got to let me get that\\n alert out!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Clark, how's the time going?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Cheyney consulted the stopwatch.\\n \\\"Deadline in twenty-nine minutes,\\\"\\n he said.\\n\\n\\n \\\"All right, let's use those minutes.\\n I'm beginning to see this thing\\n a little clearer. Joan, what we've got\\n here is a one-shot gamble; right?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"In effect,\\\" she said cautiously.\\n\\n\\n \\\"And it's my guess that we're\\n never going to get the answer by\\n diving for it\\u2014not in time, anyhow.\\n Remember when the Navy lost a\\n barge-load of shells in the harbor,\\n back in '52? They scrabbled for them\\n for a year and never pulled up a one;\\n they finally had to warn the public\\n that if it found anything funny-looking\\n along the shore it shouldn't bang\\n said object, or shake it either. We're\\n better equipped than the Navy was\\n then\\u2014but we're working against a\\n deadline.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"If you'd admitted that earlier,\\\"\\n Anderton said hoarsely, \\\"we'd have\\n half a million people out of the city\\n by now. Maybe even a million.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"We haven't given up yet, colonel.\\n The point is this, Joan: what\\n we need is an inspired guess. Get\\n anything from the prob series, Clark?\\n I thought not. On a one-shot gamble\\n of this kind, the 'laws' of chance are\\n no good at all. For that matter, the\\n so-called ESP experiments showed us\\n long ago that even the way we construct\\n random tables is full of holes\\u2014and\\n that a man with a feeling for\\n the essence of a gamble can make a\\n monkey out of chance almost at will.\\n\\n\\n \\\"And if there ever was such a\\n man, Braun is it. That's why I asked\\n him to come down here. I want him\\n to look at that lump on the screen\\n and\\u2014play a hunch.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You're out of your mind,\\\" Anderton\\n said.\\nA decorous knock spared me the\\n trouble of having to deny, affirm or\\n ignore the judgment. It was Braun;\\n the messenger had been fast, and\\n the gambler hadn't bothered to read\\n what a college student had thought\\n of him fifteen years ago. He came\\n forward and held out his hand, while\\n the others looked him over frankly.\\n\\n\\n He was impressive, all right. It\\n would have been hard for a stranger\\n to believe that he was aiming at respectability;\\n to the eye, he was already\\n there. He was tall and spare,\\n and walked perfectly erect, not without\\n spring despite his age. His clothing\\n was as far from that of a\\n gambler as you could have taken it\\n by design: a black double-breasted\\n suit with a thin vertical stripe, a gray\\n silk tie with a pearl stickpin just\\n barely large enough to be visible at\\n all, a black Homburg; all perfectly\\n fitted, all worn with proper casualness\\u2014one\\n might almost say a formal\\n casualness. It was only when he\\n opened his mouth that One-Shot\\n Braun was in the suit with him.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I come over as soon as your runner\\n got to me,\\\" he said. \\\"What's the\\n pitch, Andy?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Mr. Braun, this is Joan Hadamard,\\n Clark Cheyney, Colonel Anderton.\\n I'll be quick because we need\\n speed now. A Polish ship has dropped\\n something out in the harbor.\\n We don't know what it is. It may be\\n a hell-bomb, or it may be just somebody's\\n old laundry. Obviously we've\\n got to find out which\\u2014and we want\\n you to tell us.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Braun's aristocratic eyebrows went\\n up. \\\"Me? Hell, Andy, I don't know\\n nothing about things like that. I'm\\n surprised with you. I thought CIA\\n had all the brains it needed\\u2014ain't\\n you got machines to tell you answers\\n like that?\\\"\\n\\n\\n I pointed silently to Joan, who had\\n gone back to work the moment the\\n introductions were over. She was still\\n on the mike to the divers. She was\\n saying: \\\"What does it look like?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It's just a lump of something,\\n Dr. Hadamard. Can't even tell its\\n shape\\u2014it's buried too deeply in the\\n mud.\\\"\\nCloonk\\n...\\nOing\\n,\\noing\\n...\\n\\n\\n \\\"Try the Geiger.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"We did. Nothing but background.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Scintillation counter?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Nothing, Dr. Hadamard. Could\\n be it's shielded.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Let us do the guessing, Monig.\\n All right, maybe it's got a clockwork\\n fuse that didn't break with the impact.\\n Or a gyroscopic fuse. Stick a\\n stethoscope on it and see if you pick\\n up a ticking or anything that sounds\\n like a motor running.\\\"\\nThere was a lag and I turned back\\n to Braun. \\\"As you can see, we're\\n stymied. This is a long shot, Mr.\\n Braun. One throw of the dice\\u2014one\\n show-down hand. We've got to have\\n an expert call it for us\\u2014somebody\\n with a record of hits on long shots.\\n That's why I called you.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It's no good,\\\" he said. He took\\n off the Homburg, took his handkerchief\\n from his breast pocket, and\\n wiped the hatband. \\\"I can't do it.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Why not?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It ain't my\\nkind\\nof thing,\\\" he\\n said. \\\"Look, I never in my life run\\n odds on anything that made any difference.\\n But this makes a difference.\\n If I guess wrong\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Then we're all dead ducks. But\\n why should you guess wrong? Your\\n hunches have been working for sixty\\n years now.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Braun wiped his face. \\\"No. You\\n don't get it. I wish you'd listen to\\n me. Look, my wife and my kids are\\n in the city. It ain't only my life, it's\\n theirs, too. That's what I care about.\\n That's why it's no good. On things\\n that matter to me,\\nmy hunches don't\\n work\\n.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I was stunned, and so, I could see,\\n were Joan and Cheyney. I suppose I\\n should have guessed it, but it had\\n never occurred to me.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ten minutes,\\\" Cheyney said.\\n\\n\\n I looked up at Braun. He was\\n frightened, and again I was surprised\\n without having any right to\\n be. I tried to keep at least my voice\\n calm.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Please try it anyhow, Mr. Braun\\u2014as\\n a favor. It's already too late to\\n do it any other way. And if you guess\\n wrong, the outcome won't be any\\n worse than if you don't try at all.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"My kids,\\\" he whispered.

You ought to be shot,\\n the whole pack of you!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"No, not exactly,\\\" I said. \\\"The\\n enemy's responsible for the drop, all\\n right. We got word last month from\\n our man in Gdynia that they were\\n going to do it, and that the bomb\\n would be on board the\\nLudmilla\\n. As\\n I say, it was too good an opportunity\\n to miss. We wanted to find out just\\n how long it would take us to figure\\n out the nature of the bomb\\u2014which\\n we didn't know in detail\\u2014after it\\n was dropped here. So we had our\\n people in Gdynia defuse the thing\\n after it was put on board the ship,\\n but otherwise leave it entirely alone.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Actually, you see, your hunch was\\n right on the button as far as it went.\\n We didn't ask you whether or not\\n that object was a live bomb. We\\n asked whether it was a bomb or not.\\n You said it was, and you were right.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The expression on Braun's face\\n was exactly like the one he had worn\\n while he had been searching for his\\n decision\\u2014except that, since his eyes\\n were open, I could see that it was\\n directed at me. \\\"If this was the old\\n days,\\\" he said in an ice-cold voice,\\n \\\"I might of made the colonel's idea\\n come true. I don't go for tricks like\\n this, Andy.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It was more than a trick,\\\" Clark\\n put in. \\\"You'll remember we had\\n a deadline on the test, Mr. Braun.\\n Obviously, in a real drop we wouldn't\\n have all the time in the world\\n to figure out what kind of a thing\\n had been dropped. If we had still\\n failed to establish that when the\\n deadline ran out, we would have\\n had to allow evacuation of the city,\\n with all the attendant risk that that\\n was exactly what the enemy wanted\\n us to do.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"So?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"So we failed the test,\\\" I said. \\\"At\\n one minute short of the deadline,\\n Joan had the divers unscrew the cap.\\n In a real drop that would have resulted\\n in a detonation, if the bomb\\n was real; we'd never risk it. That\\n we did do it in the test was a concession\\n of failure\\u2014an admission that\\n our usual methods didn't come\\n through for us in time.\\n\\n\\n \\\"And that means that you were\\n the only person who did come\\n through, Mr. Braun. If a real bomb-drop\\n ever comes, we're going to have\\n to have you here, as an active part of\\n our investigation. Your intuition for\\n the one-shot gamble was the one\\n thing that bailed us out this time.\\n Next time it may save eight million\\n lives.\\\"\\n\\n\\n There was quite a long silence. All\\n of us, Anderton included, watched\\n Braun intently, but his impassive\\n face failed to show any trace of how\\n his thoughts were running.\\n\\n\\n When he did speak at last, what\\n he said must have seemed insanely\\n irrelevant to Anderton, and maybe\\n to Cheyney too. And perhaps it\\n meant nothing more to Joan than\\n the final clinical note in a case history.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It's funny,\\\" he said, \\\"I was\\n thinking of running for Congress\\n next year from my district.

But given\\n the situation that neither data\\n nor time is adequate, and an\\n answer must be produced ...\\n what do you do?\\nBY JAMES BLISH\\nIllustrated by van Dongen\\n\\n\\n On the day that the Polish freighter\\nLudmilla\\nlaid an egg in New\\n York harbor, Abner Longmans\\n (\\\"One-Shot\\\") Braun was in the city\\n going about his normal business,\\n which was making another million\\n dollars. As we found out later, almost\\n nothing else was normal about\\n that particular week end for Braun.\\n For one thing, he had brought his\\n family with him\\u2014a complete departure\\n from routine\\u2014reflecting the unprecedentedly\\n legitimate nature of\\n the deals he was trying to make.\\n From every point of view it was a\\n bad week end for the CIA to mix\\n into his affairs, but nobody had explained\\n that to the master of the\\nLudmilla\\n.\\n\\n\\n I had better add here that we\\n knew nothing about this until afterward;\\n from the point of view of the\\n storyteller, an organization like Civilian\\n Intelligence Associates gets to\\n all its facts backwards, entering the\\n tale at the pay-off, working back to\\n the hook, and winding up with a\\n sheaf of background facts to feed\\n into the computer for Next Time. It's\\n rough on the various people who've\\n tried to fictionalize what we do\\u2014particularly\\n for the lazy examples of\\n the breed, who come to us expecting\\n that their plotting has already been\\n done for them\\u2014but it's inherent in\\n the way we operate, and there it is.\\n\\n\\n Certainly nobody at CIA so much\\n as thought of Braun when the news\\n first came through. Harry Anderton,\\n the Harbor Defense chief, called us\\n at 0830 Friday to take on the job of\\n identifying the egg; this was when\\n our records show us officially entering\\n the affair, but, of course, Anderton\\n had been keeping the wires to\\n Washington steaming for an hour before\\n that, getting authorization to\\n spend some of his money on us (our\\n clearance status was then and is now\\n C&amp;R\\u2014clean and routine).\\n\\n\\n I was in the central office when\\n the call came through, and had some\\n difficulty in making out precisely\\n what Anderton wanted of us. \\\"Slow\\n down, Colonel Anderton, please,\\\" I\\n begged him. \\\"Two or three seconds\\n won't make that much difference.\\n How did you find out about this egg\\n in the first place?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"The automatic compartment bulkheads\\n on the\\nLudmilla\\nwere defective,\\\"\\n he said. \\\"It seems that this\\n egg was buried among a lot of other\\n crates in the dump-cell of the\\n hold\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"What's a dump cell?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It's a sea lock for getting rid of\\n dangerous cargo. The bottom of it\\n opens right to Davy Jones. Standard\\n fitting for ships carrying explosives,\\n radioactives, anything that might act\\n up unexpectedly.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"All right,\\\" I said. \\\"Go ahead.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, there was a timer on the\\n dump-cell floor, set to drop the egg\\n when the ship came up the river.\\n That worked fine, but the automatic\\n bulkheads that are supposed to keep\\n the rest of the ship from being flooded\\n while the cell's open, didn't. At\\n least they didn't do a thorough job.\\n The\\nLudmilla\\nbegan to list and the\\n captain yelled for help. When the\\n Harbor Patrol found the dump-cell\\n open, they called us in.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I see.\\\" I thought about it a moment.\\n \\\"In other words, you don't\\n know whether the\\nLudmilla\\nreally\\n laid an egg or not.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's what I keep trying to explain\\n to you, Dr. Harris. We don't\\n know what she dropped and we\\n haven't any way of finding out. It\\n could be a bomb\\u2014it could be anything.\\n We're sweating everybody on\\n board the ship now, but it's my guess\\n that none of them know anything;\\n the whole procedure was designed to\\n be automatic.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"All right, we'll take it,\\\" I said.\\n \\\"You've got divers down?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Sure, but\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"We'll worry about the buts from\\n here on. Get us a direct line from\\n your barge to the big board here so\\n we can direct the work. Better get\\n on over here yourself.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Right.\\\" He sounded relieved.\\n Official people have a lot of confidence\\n in CIA; too much, in my estimation.\\n Some day the job will come\\n along that we can't handle, and then\\n Washington will be kicking itself\\u2014or,\\n more likely, some scapegoat\\u2014for\\n having failed to develop a comparable\\n government department.\\n\\n\\n Not that there was much prospect\\n of Washington's doing that. Official\\n thinking had been running in the\\n other direction for years. The precedent\\n was the Associated Universities\\n organization which ran Brookhaven;\\n CIA had been started the same way,\\n by a loose corporation of universities\\n and industries all of which had\\n wanted to own an ULTIMAC and\\n no one of which had had the money\\n to buy one for itself. The Eisenhower\\n administration, with its emphasis\\n on private enterprise and concomitant\\n reluctance to sink federal\\n funds into projects of such size, had\\n turned the two examples into a nice\\n fat trend, which ULTIMAC herself\\n said wasn't going to be reversed\\n within the practicable lifetime of\\n CIA.\\nI buzzed for two staffers, and in\\n five minutes got Clark Cheyney and\\n Joan Hadamard, CIA's business manager\\n and social science division chief\\n respectively. The titles were almost\\n solely for the benefit of the T/O\\u2014that\\n is, Clark and Joan do serve in\\n those capacities, but said service takes\\n about two per cent of their capacities\\n and their time. I shot them a couple\\n of sentences of explanation, trusting\\n them to pick up whatever else they\\n needed from the tape, and checked\\n the line to the divers' barge.\\n\\n\\n It was already open; Anderton had\\n gone to work quickly and with decision\\n once he was sure we were taking\\n on the major question. The television\\n screen lit, but nothing showed\\n on it but murky light, striped with\\n streamers of darkness slowly rising\\n and falling. The audio went\\ncloonck\\n...\\noing\\n,\\noing\\n...\\nbonk\\n...\\noing\\n... Underwater noises, shapeless\\n and characterless.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Hello, out there in the harbor.\\n This is CIA, Harris calling. Come in,\\n please.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Monig here,\\\" the audio said.\\nBoink\\n...\\noing\\n,\\noing\\n...\\n\\n\\n \\\"Got anything yet?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Not a thing, Dr. Harris,\\\" Monig\\n said. \\\"You can't see three inches in\\n front of your face down here\\u2014it's\\n too silty. We've bumped into a couple\\n of crates, but so far, no egg.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Keep trying.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Cheyney, looking even more like\\n a bulldog than usual, was setting his\\n stopwatch by one of the eight clocks\\n on ULTIMAC's face. \\\"Want me to\\n take the divers?\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \\\"No, Clark, not yet. I'd rather\\n have Joan do it for the moment.\\\" I\\n passed the mike to her. \\\"You'd better\\n run a probability series first.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Check.\\\" He began feeding tape\\n into the integrator's mouth. \\\"What's\\n your angle, Peter?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"The ship. I want to see how heavily\\n shielded that dump-cell is.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It isn't shielded at all,\\\" Anderton's\\n voice said behind me. I hadn't\\n heard him come in. \\\"But that doesn't\\n prove anything. The egg might have\\n carried sufficient shielding in itself.\\n Or maybe the Commies didn't care\\n whether the crew was exposed or not.\\n Or maybe there isn't any egg.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"All that's possible,\\\" I admitted.\\n \\\"But I want to see it, anyhow.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Have you taken blood tests?\\\"\\n Joan asked Anderton.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Get the reports through to me,\\n then. I want white-cell counts, differentials,\\n platelet counts, hematocrit\\n and sed rates on every man.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Anderton picked up the phone and\\n I took a firm hold on the doorknob.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Hey,\\\" Anderton said, putting the\\n phone down again. \\\"Are you going\\n to duck out just like that? Remember,\\n Dr. Harris, we've got to evacuate the\\n city first of all! No matter whether\\n it's a real egg or not\\u2014we can't take\\n the chance on it's\\nnot\\nbeing an egg!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Don't move a man until you get\\n a go-ahead from CIA,\\\" I said. \\\"For\\n all we know now, evacuating the city\\n may be just what the enemy wants us\\n to do\\u2014so they can grab it unharmed.\\n Or they may want to start a panic\\n for some other reason, any one of\\n fifty possible reasons.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You can't take such a gamble,\\\"\\n he said grimly. \\\"There are eight and\\n a half million lives riding on it. I\\n can't let you do it.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You passed your authority to us\\n when you hired us,\\\" I pointed out.\\n \\\"If you want to evacuate without our\\n O.K., you'll have to fire us first. It'll\\n take another hour to get that cleared\\n from Washington\\u2014so you might as\\n well give us the hour.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He stared at me for a moment, his\\n lips thinned. Then he picked up the\\n phone again to order Joan's blood\\n count, and I got out the door, fast.\\nA reasonable man would have said\\n that I found nothing useful on the\\nLudmilla\\n, except negative information.\\n But the fact is that anything I\\n found would have been a surprise to\\n me; I went down looking for surprises.\\n I found nothing but a faint\\n trail to Abner Longmans Braun, most\\n of which was fifteen years cold.\\n\\n\\n There'd been a time when I'd\\n known Braun, briefly and to no\\n profit to either of us. As an undergraduate\\n majoring in social sciences,\\n I'd taken on a term paper on the old\\n International Longshoreman's Association,\\n a racket-ridden union now\\n formally extinct\\u2014although anyone\\n who knew the signs could still pick\\n up some traces on the docks. In those\\n days, Braun had been the business\\n manager of an insurance firm, the\\n sole visible function of which had\\n been to write policies for the ILA\\n and its individual dock-wallopers.\\n For some reason, he had been amused\\n by the brash youngster who'd barged\\n in on him and demanded the lowdown,\\n and had shown me considerable\\n lengths of ropes not normally\\n in view of the public\\u2014nothing incriminating,\\n but enough to give me\\n a better insight into how the union\\n operated than I had had any right to\\n expect\\u2014or even suspect.\\n\\n\\n Hence I was surprised to hear\\n somebody on the docks remark that\\n Braun was in the city over the week\\n end. It would never have occurred\\n to me that he still interested himself\\n in the waterfront, for he'd gone respectable\\n with a vengeance. He was\\n still a professional gambler, and according\\n to what he had told the\\n Congressional Investigating Committee\\n last year, took in thirty to fifty\\n thousand dollars a year at it, but his\\n gambles were no longer concentrated\\n on horses, the numbers, or shady insurance\\n deals. Nowadays what he did\\n was called investment\\u2014mostly in real\\n estate; realtors knew him well as the\\n man who had\\nalmost\\nbought the Empire\\n State Building. (The\\nalmost\\nin\\n the equation stands for the moment\\n when the shoestring broke.)\\n\\n\\n Joan had been following his career,\\n too, not because she had ever met\\n him, but because for her he was a\\n type study in the evolution of what\\n she called \\\"the extra-legal ego.\\\"\\n \\\"With personalities like that, respectability\\n is a disease,\\\" she told me.\\n \\\"There's always an almost-open conflict\\n between the desire to be powerful\\n and the desire to be accepted;\\n your ordinary criminal is a moral imbecile,\\n but people like Braun are\\n damned with a conscience, and sooner\\n or later they crack trying to appease\\n it.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'd sooner try to crack a Timkin\\n bearing,\\\" I said. \\\"Braun's ten-point\\n steel all the way through.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Don't you believe it. The symptoms\\n are showing all over him. Now\\n he's backing Broadway plays, sponsoring\\n beginning actresses, joining\\n playwrights' groups\\u2014he's the only\\n member of Buskin and Brush who's\\n never written a play, acted in one, or\\n so much as pulled the rope to raise\\n the curtain.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's investment,\\\" I said.\\n \\\"That's his business.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Peter, you're only looking at the\\n surface. His real investments almost\\n never fail. But the plays he backs\\nalways\\ndo. They have to; he's sinking\\n money in them to appease his conscience,\\n and if they were to succeed it\\n would double his guilt instead of\\n salving it. It's the same way with the\\n young actresses. He's not sexually\\n interested in them\\u2014his type never is,\\n because living a rigidly orthodox\\n family life is part of the effort towards\\n respectability. He's backing\\n them to 'pay his debt to society'\\u2014in\\n other words, they're talismans to\\n keep him out of jail.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It doesn't seem like a very satisfactory\\n substitute.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Of course it isn't,\\\" Joan had said.\\n \\\"The next thing he'll do is go in for\\n direct public service\\u2014giving money\\n to hospitals or something like that.\\n You watch.\\\"\\n\\n\\n She had been right; within the\\n year, Braun had announced the\\n founding of an association for clearing\\n the Detroit slum area where he\\n had been born\\u2014the plainest kind of\\n symbolic suicide:\\nLet's not have any\\n more Abner Longmans Brauns born\\n down here\\n. It depressed me to see it\\n happen, for next on Joan's agenda\\n for Braun was an entry into politics\\n as a fighting liberal\\u2014a New Dealer\\n twenty years too late. Since I'm mildly\\n liberal myself when I'm off duty,\\n I hated to think what Braun's career\\n might tell me about my own motives,\\n if I'd let it.\\nAll of which had nothing to do\\n with why I was prowling around the\\nLudmilla\\n\\u2014or did it? I kept remembering\\n Anderton's challenge: \\\"You\\n can't take such a gamble. There are\\n eight and a half million lives riding\\n on it\\u2014\\\" That put it up into Braun's\\n normal operating area, all right. The\\n connection was still hazy, but on the\\n grounds that any link might be useful,\\n I phoned him.\\n\\n\\n He remembered me instantly; like\\n most uneducated, power-driven men,\\n he had a memory as good as any machine's.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You never did send me that paper\\n you was going to write,\\\" he said. His\\n voice seemed absolutely unchanged,\\n although he was in his seventies now.\\n \\\"You promised you would.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Kids don't keep their promises\\n as well as they should,\\\" I said. \\\"But\\n I've still got copies and I'll see to it\\n that you get one, this time. Right\\n now I need another favor\\u2014something\\n right up your alley.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"CIA business?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes. I didn't know you knew I\\n was with CIA.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Braun chuckled. \\\"I still know a\\n thing or two,\\\" he said. \\\"What's the\\n angle?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"That I can't tell you over the\\n phone. But it's the biggest gamble\\n there ever was, and I think we need\\n an expert. Can you come down to\\n CIA's central headquarters right\\n away?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yeah, if it's that big. If it ain't,\\n I got lots of business here, Andy.\\n And I ain't going to be in town long.\\n You're sure it's top stuff?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"My word on it.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He was silent a moment. Then he\\n said, \\\"Andy, send me your paper.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"The paper? Sure, but\\u2014\\\" Then I\\n got it. I'd given him my word.\\n \\\"You'll get it,\\\" I said. \\\"Thanks, Mr.\\n Braun.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I called headquarters and sent a\\n messenger to my apartment to look\\n for one of those long-dusty blue folders\\n with the legal-length sheets inside\\n them, with orders to scorch it over\\n to Braun without stopping to breathe\\n more than once. Then I went back\\n myself.\\n\\n\\n The atmosphere had changed. Anderton\\n was sitting by the big desk,\\n clenching his fists and sweating; his\\n whole posture telegraphed his controlled\\n helplessness. Cheyney was\\n bent over a seismograph, echo-sounding\\n for the egg through the river\\n bottom. If that even had a prayer of\\n working, I knew, he'd have had the\\n trains of the Hudson &amp; Manhattan\\n stopped; their rumbling course\\n through their tubes would have\\n blanked out any possible echo-pip\\n from the egg.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Wild goose chase?\\\" Joan said,\\n scanning my face.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Not quite. I've got something, if\\n I can just figure out what it is. Remember\\n One-Shot Braun?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes. What's he got to do with\\n it?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Nothing,\\\" I said. \\\"But I want\\n to bring him in. I don't think we'll\\n lick this project before deadline without\\n him.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"What good is a professional\\n gambler on a job like this? He'll just\\n get in the way.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I looked toward the television\\n screen, which now showed an\\n amorphous black mass, jutting up\\n from a foundation of even deeper\\n black. \\\"Is that operation getting you\\n anywhere?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Nothing's gotten us anywhere,\\\"\\n Anderton interjected harshly. \\\"We\\n don't even know if that's the egg\\u2014the\\n whole area is littered with crates.\\n Harris, you've got to let me get that\\n alert out!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Clark, how's the time going?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Cheyney consulted the stopwatch.\\n \\\"Deadline in twenty-nine minutes,\\\"\\n he said.\\n\\n\\n \\\"All right, let's use those minutes.\\n I'm beginning to see this thing\\n a little clearer. Joan, what we've got\\n here is a one-shot gamble; right?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"In effect,\\\" she said cautiously.\\n\\n\\n \\\"And it's my guess that we're\\n never going to get the answer by\\n diving for it\\u2014not in time, anyhow.\\n Remember when the Navy lost a\\n barge-load of shells in the harbor,\\n back in '52? They scrabbled for them\\n for a year and never pulled up a one;\\n they finally had to warn the public\\n that if it found anything funny-looking\\n along the shore it shouldn't bang\\n said object, or shake it either. We're\\n better equipped than the Navy was\\n then\\u2014but we're working against a\\n deadline.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"If you'd admitted that earlier,\\\"\\n Anderton said hoarsely, \\\"we'd have\\n half a million people out of the city\\n by now. Maybe even a million.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"We haven't given up yet, colonel.\\n The point is this, Joan: what\\n we need is an inspired guess. Get\\n anything from the prob series, Clark?\\n I thought not. On a one-shot gamble\\n of this kind, the 'laws' of chance are\\n no good at all. For that matter, the\\n so-called ESP experiments showed us\\n long ago that even the way we construct\\n random tables is full of holes\\u2014and\\n that a man with a feeling for\\n the essence of a gamble can make a\\n monkey out of chance almost at will.\\n\\n\\n \\\"And if there ever was such a\\n man, Braun is it. That's why I asked\\n him to come down here. I want him\\n to look at that lump on the screen\\n and\\u2014play a hunch.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You're out of your mind,\\\" Anderton\\n said.\\nA decorous knock spared me the\\n trouble of having to deny, affirm or\\n ignore the judgment. It was Braun;\\n the messenger had been fast, and\\n the gambler hadn't bothered to read\\n what a college student had thought\\n of him fifteen years ago. He came\\n forward and held out his hand, while\\n the others looked him over frankly.\\n\\n\\n He was impressive, all right. It\\n would have been hard for a stranger\\n to believe that he was aiming at respectability;\\n to the eye, he was already\\n there. He was tall and spare,\\n and walked perfectly erect, not without\\n spring despite his age. His clothing\\n was as far from that of a\\n gambler as you could have taken it\\n by design: a black double-breasted\\n suit with a thin vertical stripe, a gray\\n silk tie with a pearl stickpin just\\n barely large enough to be visible at\\n all, a black Homburg; all perfectly\\n fitted, all worn with proper casualness\\u2014one\\n might almost say a formal\\n casualness. It was only when he\\n opened his mouth that One-Shot\\n Braun was in the suit with him.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I come over as soon as your runner\\n got to me,\\\" he said. \\\"What's the\\n pitch, Andy?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Mr. Braun, this is Joan Hadamard,\\n Clark Cheyney, Colonel Anderton.\\n I'll be quick because we need\\n speed now.

Obviously we've\\n got to find out which\\u2014and we want\\n you to tell us.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Braun's aristocratic eyebrows went\\n up. \\\"Me? Hell, Andy, I don't know\\n nothing about things like that. I'm\\n surprised with you. I thought CIA\\n had all the brains it needed\\u2014ain't\\n you got machines to tell you answers\\n like that?\\\"\\n\\n\\n I pointed silently to Joan, who had\\n gone back to work the moment the\\n introductions were over. She was still\\n on the mike to the divers. She was\\n saying: \\\"What does it look like?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It's just a lump of something,\\n Dr. Hadamard. Can't even tell its\\n shape\\u2014it's buried too deeply in the\\n mud.\\\"\\nCloonk\\n...\\nOing\\n,\\noing\\n...\\n\\n\\n \\\"Try the Geiger.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"We did.

Stick a\\n stethoscope on it and see if you pick\\n up a ticking or anything that sounds\\n like a motor running.\\\"\\nThere was a lag and I turned back\\n to Braun. \\\"As you can see, we're\\n stymied. This is a long shot, Mr.\\n Braun. One throw of the dice\\u2014one\\n show-down hand. We've got to have\\n an expert call it for us\\u2014somebody\\n with a record of hits on long shots.\\n That's why I called you.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It's no good,\\\" he said. He took\\n off the Homburg, took his handkerchief\\n from his breast pocket, and\\n wiped the hatband. \\\"I can't do it.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Why not?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It ain't my\\nkind\\nof thing,\\\" he\\n said. \\\"Look, I never in my life run\\n odds on anything that made any difference.\\n But this makes a difference.\\n If I guess wrong\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Then we're all dead ducks. But\\n why should you guess wrong? Your\\n hunches have been working for sixty\\n years now.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Braun wiped his face. \\\"No. You\\n don't get it. I wish you'd listen to\\n me. Look, my wife and my kids are\\n in the city. It ain't only my life, it's\\n theirs, too. That's what I care about.\\n That's why it's no good. On things\\n that matter to me,\\nmy hunches don't\\n work\\n.\\\"\\n\\n\\n I was stunned, and so, I could see,\\n were Joan and Cheyney. I suppose I\\n should have guessed it, but it had\\n never occurred to me.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ten minutes,\\\" Cheyney said.\\n\\n\\n I looked up at Braun. He was\\n frightened, and again I was surprised\\n without having any right to\\n be. I tried to keep at least my voice\\n calm.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Please try it anyhow, Mr. Braun\\u2014as\\n a favor. It's already too late to\\n do it any other way. And if you guess\\n wrong, the outcome won't be any\\n worse than if you don't try at all.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"My kids,\\\" he whispered. I don't\\n think he knew that he was speaking\\n aloud. I waited.\\n\\n\\n Then his eyes seemed to come back\\n to the present. \\\"All right,\\\" he said.\\n \\\"I told you the truth, Andy. Remember\\n that. So\\u2014is it a bomb or ain't it?\\n That's what's up for grabs, right?\\\"\\n\\n\\n I nodded. He closed his eyes. An\\n unexpected stab of pure fright went\\n down my back. Without the eyes,\\n Braun's face was a death mask.\\n\\n\\n The water sounds and the irregular\\n ticking of a Geiger counter\\n seemed to spring out from the audio\\n speaker, four times as loud as before.\\n I could even hear the pen of\\n the seismograph scribbling away, until\\n I looked at the instrument and\\n saw that Clark had stopped it, probably\\n long ago.\\n\\n\\n Droplets of sweat began to form\\n along Braun's forehead and his upper\\n lip. The handkerchief remained\\n crushed in his hand.\\n\\n\\n Anderton said, \\\"Of all the fool\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Hush!\\\" Joan said quietly.\\nSlowly, Braun opened his eyes.\\n \\\"All right,\\\" he said. \\\"You guys\\n wanted it this way.\\nI say it's a bomb.\\n\\\"\\n He stared at us for a moment more\\u2014and\\n then, all at once, the Timkin\\n bearing burst. Words poured out of\\n it. \\\"Now you guys do something, do\\n your job like I did mine\\u2014get my\\n wife and kids out of there\\u2014empty\\n the city\\u2014do something,\\ndo something\\n!\\\"\\n\\n\\n Anderton was already grabbing\\n for the phone. \\\"You're right, Mr.\\n Braun. If it isn't already too late\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n Cheyney shot out a hand and\\n caught Anderton's telephone arm by\\n the wrist. \\\"Wait a minute,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What d'you mean, 'wait a minute'?\\n Haven't you already shot\\n enough time?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Cheyney did not let go; instead,\\n he looked inquiringly at Joan and\\n said, \\\"One minute, Joan. You might\\n as well go ahead.\\\"\\n\\n\\n She nodded and spoke into the\\n mike. \\\"Monig, unscrew the cap.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Unscrew the cap?\\\" the audio\\n squawked. \\\"But Dr. Hadamard, if\\n that sets it off\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It won't go off. That's the one\\n thing you can be sure it won't do.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"What is this?\\\" Anderton demanded.\\n \\\"And what's this deadline\\n stuff, anyhow?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"The cap's off,\\\" Monig reported.\\n \\\"We're getting plenty of radiation\\n now. Just a minute\\u2014 Yeah. Dr.\\n Hadamard, it's a bomb, all right.\\n But it hasn't got a fuse. Now how\\n could they have made a fool mistake\\n like that?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"In other words, it's a dud,\\\" Joan\\n said.\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's right, a dud.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Now, at last, Braun wiped his face,\\n which was quite gray. \\\"I told you\\n the truth,\\\" he said grimly. \\\"My\\n hunches don't work on stuff like\\n this.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"But they do,\\\" I said. \\\"I'm sorry\\n we put you through the wringer\\u2014and\\n you too, colonel\\u2014but we couldn't\\n let an opportunity like this slip.\\n It was too good a chance for us to\\n test how our facilities would stand\\n up in a real bomb-drop.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"A real drop?\\\" Anderton said.\\n \\\"Are you trying to say that CIA\\n staged this? You ought to be shot,\\n the whole pack of you!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"No, not exactly,\\\" I said. \\\"The\\n enemy's responsible for the drop, all\\n right. We got word last month from\\n our man in Gdynia that they were\\n going to do it, and that the bomb\\n would be on board the\\nLudmilla\\n. As\\n I say, it was too good an opportunity\\n to miss. We wanted to find out just\\n how long it would take us to figure\\n out the nature of the bomb\\u2014which\\n we didn't know in detail\\u2014after it\\n was dropped here. So we had our\\n people in Gdynia defuse the thing\\n after it was put on board the ship,\\n but otherwise leave it entirely alone.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Actually, you see, your hunch was\\n right on the button as far as it went.\\n We didn't ask you whether or not\\n that object was a live bomb. We\\n asked whether it was a bomb or not.\\n You said it was, and you were right.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The expression on Braun's face\\n was exactly like the one he had worn\\n while he had been searching for his\\n decision\\u2014except that, since his eyes\\n were open, I could see that it was\\n directed at me. \\\"If this was the old\\n days,\\\" he said in an ice-cold voice,\\n \\\"I might of made the colonel's idea\\n come true. I don't go for tricks like\\n this, Andy.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It was more than a trick,\\\" Clark\\n put in. \\\"You'll remember we had\\n a deadline on the test, Mr. Braun.\\n Obviously, in a real drop we wouldn't\\n have all the time in the world\\n to figure out what kind of a thing\\n had been dropped. If we had still\\n failed to establish that when the\\n deadline ran out, we would have\\n had to allow evacuation of the city,\\n with all the attendant risk that that\\n was exactly what the enemy wanted\\n us to do.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"So?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"So we failed the test,\\\" I said. \\\"At\\n one minute short of the deadline,\\n Joan had the divers unscrew the cap.\\n In a real drop that would have resulted\\n in a detonation, if the bomb\\n was real; we'd never risk it. That\\n we did do it in the test was a concession\\n of failure\\u2014an admission that\\n our usual methods didn't come\\n through for us in time.\\n\\n\\n \\\"And that means that you were\\n the only person who did come\\n through, Mr. Braun. If a real bomb-drop\\n ever comes, we're going to have\\n to have you here, as an active part of\\n our investigation. Your intuition for\\n the one-shot gamble was the one\\n thing that bailed us out this time.\\n Next time it may save eight million\\n lives.\\\"\\n\\n\\n There was quite a long silence. All\\n of us, Anderton included, watched\\n Braun intently, but his impassive\\n face failed to show any trace of how\\n his thoughts were running.\\n\\n\\n When he did speak at last, what\\n he said must have seemed insanely\\n irrelevant to Anderton, and maybe\\n to Cheyney too. And perhaps it\\n meant nothing more to Joan than\\n the final clinical note in a case history.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It's funny,\\\" he said, \\\"I was\\n thinking of running for Congress\\n next year from my district. But maybe\\n this is more important.\\\"\\n\\n\\n It was, I believe, the sigh of a man\\n at peace with himself.\\nTranscriber's Note:\\nThis etext was produced from\\nAstounding Science Fiction\\nAugust\\n 1955.
