T. HAGGERT\\n\\n\\n Illustrated by WOOD\\n\\n\\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\\n\\n Galaxy Magazine August 1959.\\n\\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\\n\\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\\nNothing in the world could be happier and\\n \\nmere serene than a man who loves his work\\u2014but\\n \\nwhat happens when it loves him back?\\nKeep your nerve, Peter Manners told himself; it's only a job. But nerve\\n has to rest on a sturdier foundation than cash reserves just above zero\\n and eviction if he came away from this interview still unemployed.\\n Clay, at the Association of Professional Engineers, who had set up the\\n appointment, hadn't eased Peter's nervousness by admitting, \\\"I don't\\n know what in hell he's looking for. He's turned down every man we've\\n sent him.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The interview was at three. Fifteen minutes to go. Coming early would\\n betray overeagerness. Peter stood in front of the Lex Industries plant\\n and studied it to kill time. Plain, featureless concrete walls, not\\n large for a manufacturing plant\\u2014it took a scant minute to exhaust its\\n sightseeing potential. If he walked around the building, he could, if\\n he ambled, come back to the front entrance just before three.\\n\\n\\n He turned the corner, stopped, frowned, wondering what there was about\\n the building that seemed so puzzling. It could not have been plainer,\\n more ordinary. It was in fact, he only gradually realized, so plain and\\n ordinary that it was like no other building he had ever seen.\\n\\n\\n There had been windows at the front. There were none at the side, and\\n none at the rear. Then how were the working areas lit? He looked for\\n the electric service lines and found them at one of the rear corners.\\n They jolted him. The distribution transformers were ten times as large\\n as they should have been for a plant this size.\\n\\n\\n Something else was wrong. Peter looked for minutes before he found out\\n what it was. Factories usually have large side doorways for employees\\n changing shifts. This building had one small office entrance facing the\\n street, and the only other door was at the loading bay\\u2014big enough to\\n handle employee traffic, but four feet above the ground. Without any\\n stairs, it could be used only by trucks backing up to it. Maybe the\\n employees' entrance was on the third side.\\n\\n\\n It wasn't.\\nStaring back at the last blank wall, Peter suddenly remembered the time\\n he had set out to kill. He looked at his watch and gasped. At a run,\\n set to straight-arm the door, he almost fell on his face. The door had\\n opened by itself. He stopped and looked for a photo-electric eye, but\\n a soft voice said through a loudspeaker in the anteroom wall: \\\"Mr.\\n Manners?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"What?\\\" he panted. \\\"Who\\u2014?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You\\nare\\nMr. Manners?\\\" the voice asked.\\n\\n\\n He nodded, then realized he had to answer aloud if there was a\\n microphone around; but the soft voice said: \\\"Follow the open doors down\\n the hall. Mr. Lexington is expecting you.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Thanks,\\\" Peter said, and a door at one side of the anteroom swung open\\n for him.\\n\\n\\n He went through it with his composure slipping still further from his\\n grip. This was no way to go into an interview, but doors kept opening\\n before and shutting after him, until only one was left, and the last of\\n his calm was blasted away by a bellow from within.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Don't stand out there like a jackass! Either come in or go away!\\\"\\n\\n\\n Peter found himself leaping obediently toward the doorway. He stopped\\n just short of it, took a deep breath and huffed it out, took another,\\n all the while thinking, Hold on now; you're in no shape for an\\n interview\\u2014and it's not your fault\\u2014this whole setup is geared to\\n unnerve you: the kindergarten kid called in to see the principal.\\n\\n\\n He let another bellow bounce off him as he blew out the second breath,\\n straightened his jacket and tie, and walked in as an engineer applying\\n for a position should.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Mr. Lexington?\\\" he said. \\\"I'm Peter Manners. The Association\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Sit down,\\\" said the man at the desk. \\\"Let's look you over.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He was a huge man behind an even huger desk. Peter took a chair in\\n front of the desk and let himself be inspected. It wasn't comfortable.\\n He did some looking over of his own to ease the tension.\\n\\n\\n The room was more than merely large, carpeted throughout with\\n a high-pile, rich, sound-deadening rug. The oversized desk and\\n massive leather chairs, heavy patterned drapes, ornately framed\\n paintings\\u2014by God, even a glass-brick manteled fireplace and bowls with\\n flowers!\\u2014made him feel as if he had walked down a hospital corridor\\n into Hollywood's idea of an office.\\n\\n\\n His eyes eventually had to move to Lexington, and they were daunted\\n for another instant. This was a citadel of a man\\u2014great girders of\\n frame supporting buttresses of muscle\\u2014with a vaulting head and\\n drawbridge chin and a steel gaze that defied any attempt to storm it.\\n\\n\\n But then Peter came out of his momentary flinch, and there was an age\\n to the man, about 65, and he saw the muscles had turned to fat, the\\n complexion ashen, the eyes set deep as though retreating from pain, and\\n this was a citadel of a man, yes, but beginning to crumble.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What can you do?\\\" asked Lexington abruptly.\\nPeter started, opened his mouth to answer, closed it again. He'd been\\n jolted too often in too short a time to be stampeded into blurting a\\n reply that would cost him this job.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Good,\\\" said Lexington. \\\"Only a fool would try to answer that. Do you\\n have any knowledge of medicine?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Not enough to matter,\\\" Peter said, stung by the compliment.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I don't mean how to bandage a cut or splint a broken arm. I mean\\n things like cell structure, neural communication\\u2014the\\nbasics\\nof how\\n we live.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'm applying for a job as engineer.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I know. Are you interested in the basics of how we live?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Peter looked for a hidden trap, found none. \\\"Of course. Isn't everyone?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Less than you think,\\\" Lexington said. \\\"It's the preconceived notions\\n they're interested in protecting. At least I won't have to beat them\\n out of you.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Thanks,\\\" said Peter, and waited for the next fast ball.\\n\\n\\n \\\"How long have you been out of school?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Only two years. But you knew that from the Association\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"No practical experience to speak of?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Some,\\\" said Peter, stung again, this time not by a compliment. \\\"After\\n I got my degree, I went East for a post-graduate training program with\\n an electrical manufacturer. I got quite a bit of experience there. The\\n company\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Stockpiled you,\\\" Lexington said.\\n\\n\\n Peter blinked. \\\"Sir?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Stockpiled you! How much did they pay you?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Not very much, but we were getting the training instead of wages.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Did that come out of the pamphlets they gave you?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Did what come out\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"That guff about receiving training instead of wages!\\\" said Lexington.\\n \\\"Any company that really wants bright trainees will compete for them\\n with money\\u2014cold, hard cash, not platitudes. Maybe you saw a few of\\n their products being made, maybe you didn't. But you're a lot weaker in\\n calculus than when you left school, and in a dozen other subjects too,\\n aren't you?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, nothing we did on the course involved higher mathematics,\\\" Peter\\n admitted cautiously, \\\"and I suppose I could use a refresher course in\\n calculus.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Just as I said\\u2014they stockpiled you, instead of using you as an\\n engineer. They hired you at a cut wage and taught you things that would\\n be useful only in their own company, while in the meantime you were\\n getting weaker in the subjects you'd paid to learn. Or are you one of\\n these birds that had the shot paid for him?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I worked my way through,\\\" said Peter stiffly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"If you'd stayed with them five years, do you think you'd be able to\\n get a job with someone else?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Peter considered his answer carefully. Every man the Association had\\n sent had been turned away. That meant bluffs didn't work. Neither, he'd\\n seen for himself, did allowing himself to be intimidated.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I hadn't thought about it,\\\" he said. \\\"I suppose it wouldn't have been\\n easy.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Impossible, you mean. You wouldn't know a single thing except their\\n procedures, their catalogue numbers, their way of doing things. And\\n you'd have forgotten so much of your engineering training, you'd be\\n scared to take on an engineer's job, for fear you'd be asked to do\\n something you'd forgotten how to do. At that point, they could take you\\n out of the stockpile, put you in just about any job they wanted, at\\n any wage you'd stand for, and they'd have an indentured worker with a\\n degree\\u2014but not the price tag. You see that now?\\\"\\nIt made Peter feel he had been suckered, but he had decided to play\\n this straight all the way. He nodded.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Why'd you leave?\\\" Lexington pursued, unrelenting.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I finished the course and the increase they offered on a permanent\\n basis wasn't enough, so I went elsewhere\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"With your head full of this nonsense about a shortage of engineers.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Peter swallowed. \\\"I thought it would be easier to get a job than it has\\n been, yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"They start the talk about a shortage and then they keep it going. Why?\\n So youngsters will take up engineering thinking they'll wind up among a\\n highly paid minority. You did, didn't you?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes, sir.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"And so did all the others there with you, at school and in this\\n stockpiling outfit?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's right.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well,\\\" said Lexington unexpectedly, \\\"there\\nis\\na shortage! And the\\n stockpiles are the ones who made it, and who keep it going! And the\\n hell of it is that they can't stop\\u2014when one does it, they all have\\n to, or their costs get out of line and they can't compete. What's the\\n solution?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I don't know,\\\" Peter said.\\n\\n\\n Lexington leaned back. \\\"That's quite a lot of admissions you've made.\\n What makes you think you're qualified for the job I'm offering?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You said you wanted an engineer.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"And I've just proved you're less of an engineer than when you left\\n school. I have, haven't I?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"All right, you have,\\\" Peter said angrily.\\n\\n\\n \\\"And now you're wondering why I don't get somebody fresh out of school.\\n Right?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Peter straightened up and met the old man's challenging gaze. \\\"That and\\n whether you're giving me a hard time just for the hell of it.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, am I?\\\" Lexington demanded.\\n\\n\\n Looking at him squarely, seeing the intensity of the pain-drawn eyes,\\n Peter had the startling feeling that Lexington was rooting for him!\\n \\\"No, you're not.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Then what am I after?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Suppose you tell me.\\\"\\n\\n\\n So suddenly that it was almost like a collapse, the tension went out\\n of the old man's face and shoulders. He nodded with inexpressible\\n tiredness. \\\"Good again. The man I want doesn't exist. He has to\\n be made\\u2014the same as I was. You qualify, so far. You've lost your\\n illusions, but haven't had time yet to replace them with dogma or\\n cynicism or bitterness. You saw immediately that fake humility\\n or cockiness wouldn't get you anywhere here, and you were right.\\n Those were the important things. The background data I got from the\\n Association on you counted, of course, but only if you were teachable.\\n I think you are. Am I right?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"At least I can face knowing how much I don't know,\\\" said Peter, \\\"if\\n that answers the question.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It does. Partly. What did you notice about this plant?\\\"\\n\\n\\n In precis form, Peter listed his observations: the absence of windows\\n at sides and rear, the unusual amount of power, the automatic doors,\\n the lack of employees' entrances.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Very good,\\\" said Lexington. \\\"Most people only notice the automatic\\n doors. Anything else?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes,\\\" Peter said. \\\"You're the only person I've seen in the building.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'm the only one there is.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Peter stared his disbelief. Automated plants were nothing new, but\\n they all had their limitations. Either they dealt with exactly similar\\n products or things that could be handled on a flow basis, like oil or\\n water-soluble chemicals. Even these had no more to do than process the\\n goods.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Come on,\\\" said Lexington, getting massively to his feet. \\\"I'll show\\n you.\\\"\\nThe office door opened, and Peter found himself being led down the\\n antiseptic corridor to another door which had opened, giving access to\\n the manufacturing area. As they moved along, between rows of seemingly\\n disorganized machinery, Peter noticed that the factory lights high\\n overhead followed their progress, turning themselves on in advance\\n of their coming, and going out after they had passed, keeping a pool\\n of illumination only in the immediate area they occupied. Soon they\\n reached a large door which Peter recognized as the inside of the truck\\n loading door he had seen from outside.\\n\\n\\n Lexington paused here. \\\"This is the bay used by the trucks arriving\\n with raw materials,\\\" he said. \\\"They back up to this door, and a set\\n of automatic jacks outside lines up the trailer body with the door\\n exactly. Then the door opens and the truck is unloaded by these\\n materials handling machines.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Peter didn't see him touch anything, but as he spoke, three glistening\\n machines, apparently self-powered, rolled noiselessly up to the door in\\n formation and stopped there, apparently waiting to be inspected.\\n\\n\\n They gave Peter the creeps. Simple square boxes, set on casters, with\\n two arms each mounted on the sides might have looked similar. The arms,\\n fashioned much like human arms, hung at the sides, not limply, but in a\\n relaxed position that somehow indicated readiness.\\n\\n\\n Lexington went over to one of them and patted it lovingly. \\\"Really,\\n these machines are only an extension of one large machine. The whole\\n plant, as a matter of fact, is controlled from one point and is really\\n a single unit. These materials handlers, or manipulators, were about\\n the toughest things in the place to design. But they're tremendously\\n useful. You'll see a lot of them around.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Lexington was about to leave the side of the machine when abruptly one\\n of the arms rose to the handkerchief in his breast pocket and daintily\\n tugged it into a more attractive position. It took only a split second,\\n and before Lexington could react, all three machines were moving away\\n to attend to mysterious duties of their own.\\nPeter tore his eyes away from them in time to see the look of\\n frustrated embarrassment that crossed Lexington's face, only to be\\n replaced by one of anger. He said nothing, however, and led Peter to\\n a large bay where racks of steel plate, bar forms, nuts, bolts, and\\n other materials were stored.\\n\\n\\n \\\"After unloading a truck, the machines check the shipment, report any\\n shortages or overages, and store the materials here,\\\" he said, the\\n trace of anger not yet gone from his voice. \\\"When an order is received,\\n it's translated into the catalogue numbers used internally within the\\n plant, and machines like the ones you just saw withdraw the necessary\\n materials from stock, make the component parts, assemble them, and\\n package the finished goods for shipment. Simultaneously, an order is\\n sent to the billing section to bill the customer, and an order is\\n sent to our trucker to come and pick the shipment up. Meanwhile, if\\n the withdrawal of the materials required has depleted our stock, the\\n purchasing section is instructed to order more raw materials. I'll take\\n you through the manufacturing and assembly sections right now, but\\n they're too noisy for me to explain what's going on while we're there.\\\"\\nPeter followed numbly as Lexington led him through a maze of machines,\\n each one seemingly intent on cutting, bending, welding, grinding\\n or carrying some bit of metal, or just standing idle, waiting for\\n something to do. The two-armed manipulators Peter had just seen were\\n everywhere, scuttling from machine to machine, apparently with an\\n exact knowledge of what they were doing and the most efficient way of\\n doing it.\\n\\n\\n He wondered what would happen if one of them tried to use the same\\n aisle they were using. He pictured a futile attempt to escape the\\n onrushing wheels, saw himself clambering out of the path of the\\n speeding vehicle just in time to fall into the jaws of the punch press\\n that was laboring beside him at the moment. Nervously, he looked for an\\n exit, but his apprehension was unnecessary. The machines seemed to know\\n where they were and avoided the two men, or stopped to wait for them to\\n go by.\\n\\n\\n Back in the office section of the building, Lexington indicated a small\\n room where a typewriter could be heard clattering away. \\\"Standard\\n business machines, operated by the central control mechanism. In\\n that room,\\\" he said, as the door swung open and Peter saw that the\\n typewriter was actually a sort of teletype, with no one before the\\n keyboard, \\\"incoming mail is sorted and inquiries are replied to. In\\n this one over here, purchase orders are prepared, and across the hall\\n there's a very similar rig set up in conjunction with an automatic\\n bookkeeper to keep track of the pennies and to bill the customers.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Then all you do is read the incoming mail and maintain the machinery?\\\"\\n asked Peter, trying to shake off the feeling of open amazement that\\n had engulfed him.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I don't even do those things, except for a few letters that come in\\n every week that\\u2014it doesn't want to deal with by itself.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The shock of what he had just seen was showing plainly on Peter's face\\n when they walked back into Lexington's office and sat down. Lexington\\n looked at him for quite a while without saying anything, his face\\n sagging and pale. Peter didn't trust himself to speak, and let the\\n silence remain unbroken.\\n\\n\\n Finally Lexington spoke. \\\"I know it's hard to believe, but there it is.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Hard to believe?\\\" said Peter. \\\"I almost can't. The trade journals run\\n articles about factories like this one, but planned for ten, maybe\\n twenty years in the future.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Damn fools!\\\" exclaimed Lexington, getting part of his breath back.\\n \\\"They could have had it years ago, if they'd been willing to drop their\\n idiotic notions about specialization.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Lexington mopped his forehead with a large white handkerchief.\\n Apparently the walk through the factory had tired him considerably,\\n although it hadn't been strenuous.\\nHe leaned back in his chair and began to talk in a low voice completely\\n in contrast with the overbearing manner he had used upon Peter's\\n arrival. \\\"You know what we make, of course.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes, sir. Conduit fittings.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"And a lot of other electrical products, too. I started out in this\\n business twenty years ago, using orthodox techniques. I never got\\n through university. I took a couple of years of an arts course, and\\n got so interested in biology that I didn't study anything else.\\n They bounced me out of the course, and I re-entered in engineering,\\n determined not to make the same mistake again. But I did. I got too\\n absorbed in those parts of the course that had to do with electrical\\n theory and lost the rest as a result. The same thing happened when I\\n tried commerce, with accounting, so I gave up and started working for\\n one of my competitors. It wasn't too long before I saw that the only\\n way I could get ahead was to open up on my own.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Lexington sank deeper in his chair and stared at the ceiling as he\\n spoke. \\\"I put myself in hock to the eyeballs, which wasn't easy,\\n because I had just got married, and started off in a very small way.\\n After three years, I had a fairly decent little business going, and I\\n suppose it would have grown just like any other business, except for\\n a strike that came along and put me right back where I started. My\\n wife, whom I'm afraid I had neglected for the sake of the business,\\n was killed in a car accident about then, and rightly or wrongly, that\\n made me angrier with the union than anything else. If the union hadn't\\n made things so tough for me from the beginning, I'd have had more time\\n to spend with my wife before her death. As things turned out\\u2014well, I\\n remember looking down at her coffin and thinking that I hardly knew the\\n girl.\\n\\n\\n \\\"For the next few years, I concentrated on getting rid of as many\\n employees as I could, by replacing them with automatic machines. I'd\\n design the control circuits myself, in many cases wire the things up\\n myself, always concentrating on replacing men with machines. But it\\n wasn't very successful. I found that the more automatic I made my\\n plant, the lower my costs went. The lower my costs went, the more\\n business I got, and the more I had to expand.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Lexington scowled. \\\"I got sick of it. I decided to try developing one\\n multi-purpose control circuit that would control everything, from\\n ordering the raw materials to shipping the finished goods. As I told\\n you, I had taken quite an interest in biology when I was in school,\\n and from studies of nerve tissue in particular, plus my electrical\\n knowledge, I had a few ideas on how to do it. It took me three years,\\n but I began to see that I could develop circuitry that could remember,\\n compare, detect similarities, and so on. Not the way they do it today,\\n of course. To do what I wanted to do with these big clumsy magnetic\\n drums, tapes, and what-not, you'd need a building the size of Mount\\n Everest. But I found that I could let organic chemistry do most of the\\n work for me.\\n\\n\\n \\\"By creating the proper compounds, with their molecules arranged in\\n predetermined matrixes, I found I could duplicate electrical circuitry\\n in units so tiny that my biggest problem was getting into and out of\\n the logic units with conventional wiring. I finally beat that the same\\n way they solved the problem of translating a picture on a screen into\\n electrical signals, developed equipment to scan the units cyclically,\\n and once I'd done that, the battle was over.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I built this building and incorporated it as a separate company, to\\n compete with my first outfit. In the beginning, I had it rigged up to\\n do only the manual work that you saw being done a few minutes ago in\\n the back of this place. I figured that the best thing for me to do\\n would be to turn the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers, leaving\\n me free to do nothing except receive orders, punch the catalogue\\n numbers into the control console, do the billing, and collect the\\n money.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"What happened to your original company?\\\" Peter asked.\\nLexington smiled. \\\"Well, automated as it was, it couldn't compete with\\n this plant. It gave me great pleasure, three years after this one\\n started working, to see my old company go belly up. This company bought\\n the old firm's equipment for next to nothing and I wound up with all my\\n assets, but only one employee\\u2014me.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I thought everything would be rosy from that point on, but it\\n wasn't. I found that I couldn't keep up with the mail unless I worked\\n impossible hours. I added a couple of new pieces of equipment to the\\n control section. One was simply a huge memory bank. The other was\\n a comparator circuit. A complicated one, but a comparator circuit\\n nevertheless. Here I was working on instinct more than anything. I\\n figured that if I interconnected these circuits in such a way that\\n they could sense everything that went on in the plant, and compare one\\n action with another, by and by the unit would be able to see patterns.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Then, through the existing command output, I figured these new units\\n would be able to control the plant, continuing the various patterns of\\n activity that I'd already established.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Here Lexington frowned. \\\"It didn't work worth a damn! It just sat there\\n and did nothing. I couldn't understand it for the longest time, and\\n then I realized what the trouble was. I put a kicker circuit into it, a\\n sort of voltage-bias network. I reset the equipment so that while it\\n was still under instructions to receive orders and produce goods, its\\n prime purpose was to activate the kicker. The kicker, however, could\\n only be activated by me, manually. Lastly, I set up one of the early\\n TV pickups over the mail slitter and allowed every letter I received,\\n every order, to be fed into the memory banks. That did it.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I\\u2014I don't understand,\\\" stammered Peter.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Simple! Whenever I was pleased that things were going smoothly, I\\n pressed the kicker button. The machine had one purpose, so far as its\\n logic circuits were concerned. Its object was to get me to press that\\n button. Every day I'd press it at the same time, unless things weren't\\n going well. If there had been trouble in the shop, I'd press it late,\\n or maybe not at all. If all the orders were out on schedule, or ahead\\n of time, I'd press it ahead of time, or maybe twice in the same day.\\n Pretty soon the machine got the idea.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'll never forget the day I picked up an incoming order form from one\\n of the western jobbers, and found that the keyboard was locked when I\\n tried to punch it into the control console. It completely baffled me\\n at first. Then, while I was tracing out the circuits to see if I could\\n discover what was holding the keyboard lock in, I noticed that the\\n order was already entered on the in-progress list. I was a long time\\n convincing myself that it had really happened, but there was no other\\n explanation.\\n\\n\\n \\\"The machine had realized that whenever one of those forms came in, I\\n copied the list of goods from it onto the in-progress list through the\\n console keyboard, thus activating the producing mechanisms in the back\\n of the plant. The machine had done it for me this time, then locked the\\n keyboard so I couldn't enter the order twice. I think I held down the\\n kicker button for a full five minutes that day.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"This kicker button,\\\" Peter said tentatively, \\\"it's like the pleasure\\n center in an animal's brain, isn't it?\\\"\\nWhen Lexington beamed, Peter felt a surge of relief. Talking with this\\n man was like walking a tightrope. A word too much or a word too little\\n might mean the difference between getting the job or losing it.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Exactly!\\\" whispered Lexington, in an almost conspiratorial tone. \\\"I\\n had altered the circuitry of the machine so that it tried to give\\n me pleasure\\u2014because by doing so, its own pleasure circuit would be\\n activated.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Things went fast from then on. Once I realized that the machine\\n was learning, I put TV monitors all over the place, so the machine\\n could watch everything that was going on. After a short while I had\\n to increase the memory bank, and later I increased it again, but the\\n rewards were worth it. Soon, by watching what I did, and then by doing\\n it for me next time it had to be done, the machine had learned to do\\n almost everything, and I had time to sit back and count my winnings.\\\"\\n\\n\\n At this point the door opened, and a small self-propelled cart wheeled\\n silently into the room. Stopping in front of Peter, it waited until he\\n had taken a small plate laden with two or three cakes off its surface.\\n Then the soft, evenly modulated voice he had heard before asked, \\\"How\\n do you like your coffee? Cream, sugar, both or black?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Peter looked for the speaker in the side of the cart, saw nothing, and\\n replied, feeling slightly silly as he did so, \\\"Black, please.\\\"\\n\\n\\n A square hole appeared in the top of the cart, like the elevator hole\\n in an aircraft carrier's deck. When the section of the cart's surface\\n rose again, a fine china cup containing steaming black coffee rested\\n on it. Peter took it and sipped it, as he supposed he was expected to\\n do, while the cart proceeded over to Lexington's desk. Once there, it\\n stopped again, and another cup of coffee rose to its surface.\\nLexington took the coffee from the top of the car, obviously angry\\n about something. Silently, he waited until the cart had left the\\n office, then snapped, \\\"Look at those bloody cups!\\\"\\n\\n\\n Peter looked at his, which was eggshell thin, fluted with carving and\\n ornately covered with gold leaf. \\\"They look very expensive,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Not only expensive, but stupid and impractical!\\\" exploded Lexington.\\n \\\"They only hold half a cup, they'll break at a touch, every one has to\\n be matched with its own saucer, and if you use them for any length of\\n time, the gold leaf comes off!\\\"\\n\\n\\n Peter searched for a comment, found none that fitted this odd outburst,\\n so he kept silent.\\nLexington stared at his cup without touching it for a long while. Then\\n he continued with his narrative. \\\"I suppose it's all my own fault. I\\n didn't detect the symptoms soon enough. After this plant got working\\n properly, I started living here. It wasn't a question of saving money.\\n I hated to waste two hours a day driving to and from my house, and I\\n also wanted to be on hand in case anything should go wrong that the\\n machine couldn't fix for itself.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Handling the cup as if it were going to shatter at any moment, he took\\n a gulp. \\\"I began to see that the machine could understand the written\\n word, and I tried hooking a teletype directly into the logic circuits.\\n It was like uncorking a seltzer bottle. The machine had a funny\\n vocabulary\\u2014all of it gleaned from letters it had seen coming in, and\\n replies it had seen leaving. But it was intelligible. It even displayed\\n some traces of the personality the machine was acquiring.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It had chosen a name for itself, for instance\\u2014'Lex.' That shook me.\\n You might think Lex Industries was named through an abbreviation of\\n the name Lexington, but it wasn't. My wife's name was Alexis, and it\\n was named after the nickname she always used. I objected, of course,\\n but how can you object on a point like that to a machine? Bear in mind\\n that I had to be careful to behave reasonably at all times, because the\\n machine was still learning from me, and I was afraid that any tantrums\\n I threw might be imitated.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It sounds pretty awkward,\\\" Peter put in.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You don't know the half of it! As time went on, I had less and less to\\n do, and business-wise I found that the entire control of the operation\\n was slipping from my grasp. Many times I discovered\\u2014too late\\u2014that\\n the machine had taken the damnedest risks you ever saw on bids and\\n contracts for supply. It was quoting impossible delivery times on\\n some orders, and charging pirate's prices on others, all without any\\n obvious reason. Inexplicably, we always came out on top. It would turn\\n out that on the short-delivery-time quotations, we'd been up against\\n stiff competition, and cutting the production time was the only way we\\n could get the order. On the high-priced quotes, I'd find that no one\\n else was bidding. We were making more money than I'd ever dreamed of,\\n and to make it still better, I'd find that for months I had virtually\\n nothing to do.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It sounds wonderful, sir,\\\" said Peter, feeling dazzled.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It was, in a way. I remember one day I was especially pleased with\\n something, and I went to the control console to give the kicker button\\n a long, hard push. The button, much to my amazement, had been removed,\\n and a blank plate had been installed to cover the opening in the board.\\n I went over to the teletype and punched in the shortest message I had\\n ever sent. 'LEX\\u2014WHAT THE HELL?' I typed.\\n\\n\\n \\\"The answer came back in the jargon it had learned from letters it had\\n seen, and I remember it as if it just happened. 'MR.

T. HAGGERT\\n\\n\\n Illustrated by WOOD\\n\\n\\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\\n\\n Galaxy Magazine August 1959.\\n\\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\\n\\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\\nNothing in the world could be happier and\\n \\nmere serene than a man who loves his work\\u2014but\\n \\nwhat happens when it loves him back?\\nKeep your nerve, Peter Manners told himself; it's only a job. But nerve\\n has to rest on a sturdier foundation than cash reserves just above zero\\n and eviction if he came away from this interview still unemployed.\\n Clay, at the Association of Professional Engineers, who had set up the\\n appointment, hadn't eased Peter's nervousness by admitting, \\\"I don't\\n know what in hell he's looking for. He's turned down every man we've\\n sent him.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The interview was at three. Fifteen minutes to go. Coming early would\\n betray overeagerness. Peter stood in front of the Lex Industries plant\\n and studied it to kill time. Plain, featureless concrete walls, not\\n large for a manufacturing plant\\u2014it took a scant minute to exhaust its\\n sightseeing potential. If he walked around the building, he could, if\\n he ambled, come back to the front entrance just before three.\\n\\n\\n He turned the corner, stopped, frowned, wondering what there was about\\n the building that seemed so puzzling. It could not have been plainer,\\n more ordinary. It was in fact, he only gradually realized, so plain and\\n ordinary that it was like no other building he had ever seen.\\n\\n\\n There had been windows at the front. There were none at the side, and\\n none at the rear. Then how were the working areas lit? He looked for\\n the electric service lines and found them at one of the rear corners.\\n They jolted him. The distribution transformers were ten times as large\\n as they should have been for a plant this size.\\n\\n\\n Something else was wrong. Peter looked for minutes before he found out\\n what it was. Factories usually have large side doorways for employees\\n changing shifts. This building had one small office entrance facing the\\n street, and the only other door was at the loading bay\\u2014big enough to\\n handle employee traffic, but four feet above the ground. Without any\\n stairs, it could be used only by trucks backing up to it. Maybe the\\n employees' entrance was on the third side.\\n\\n\\n It wasn't.\\nStaring back at the last blank wall, Peter suddenly remembered the time\\n he had set out to kill. He looked at his watch and gasped. At a run,\\n set to straight-arm the door, he almost fell on his face. The door had\\n opened by itself. He stopped and looked for a photo-electric eye, but\\n a soft voice said through a loudspeaker in the anteroom wall: \\\"Mr.\\n Manners?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"What?\\\" he panted. \\\"Who\\u2014?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You\\nare\\nMr. Manners?\\\" the voice asked.\\n\\n\\n He nodded, then realized he had to answer aloud if there was a\\n microphone around; but the soft voice said: \\\"Follow the open doors down\\n the hall. Mr. Lexington is expecting you.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Thanks,\\\" Peter said, and a door at one side of the anteroom swung open\\n for him.\\n\\n\\n He went through it with his composure slipping still further from his\\n grip. This was no way to go into an interview, but doors kept opening\\n before and shutting after him, until only one was left, and the last of\\n his calm was blasted away by a bellow from within.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Don't stand out there like a jackass! Either come in or go away!\\\"\\n\\n\\n Peter found himself leaping obediently toward the doorway. He stopped\\n just short of it, took a deep breath and huffed it out, took another,\\n all the while thinking, Hold on now; you're in no shape for an\\n interview\\u2014and it's not your fault\\u2014this whole setup is geared to\\n unnerve you: the kindergarten kid called in to see the principal.\\n\\n\\n He let another bellow bounce off him as he blew out the second breath,\\n straightened his jacket and tie, and walked in as an engineer applying\\n for a position should.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Mr. Lexington?\\\" he said. \\\"I'm Peter Manners. The Association\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Sit down,\\\" said the man at the desk. \\\"Let's look you over.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He was a huge man behind an even huger desk. Peter took a chair in\\n front of the desk and let himself be inspected. It wasn't comfortable.\\n He did some looking over of his own to ease the tension.\\n\\n\\n The room was more than merely large, carpeted throughout with\\n a high-pile, rich, sound-deadening rug. The oversized desk and\\n massive leather chairs, heavy patterned drapes, ornately framed\\n paintings\\u2014by God, even a glass-brick manteled fireplace and bowls with\\n flowers!\\u2014made him feel as if he had walked down a hospital corridor\\n into Hollywood's idea of an office.\\n\\n\\n His eyes eventually had to move to Lexington, and they were daunted\\n for another instant. This was a citadel of a man\\u2014great girders of\\n frame supporting buttresses of muscle\\u2014with a vaulting head and\\n drawbridge chin and a steel gaze that defied any attempt to storm it.\\n\\n\\n But then Peter came out of his momentary flinch, and there was an age\\n to the man, about 65, and he saw the muscles had turned to fat, the\\n complexion ashen, the eyes set deep as though retreating from pain, and\\n this was a citadel of a man, yes, but beginning to crumble.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What can you do?\\\" asked Lexington abruptly.\\nPeter started, opened his mouth to answer, closed it again. He'd been\\n jolted too often in too short a time to be stampeded into blurting a\\n reply that would cost him this job.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Good,\\\" said Lexington. \\\"Only a fool would try to answer that. Do you\\n have any knowledge of medicine?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Not enough to matter,\\\" Peter said, stung by the compliment.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I don't mean how to bandage a cut or splint a broken arm. I mean\\n things like cell structure, neural communication\\u2014the\\nbasics\\nof how\\n we live.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'm applying for a job as engineer.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I know. Are you interested in the basics of how we live?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Peter looked for a hidden trap, found none. \\\"Of course. Isn't everyone?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Less than you think,\\\" Lexington said. \\\"It's the preconceived notions\\n they're interested in protecting. At least I won't have to beat them\\n out of you.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Thanks,\\\" said Peter, and waited for the next fast ball.\\n\\n\\n \\\"How long have you been out of school?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Only two years. But you knew that from the Association\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"No practical experience to speak of?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Some,\\\" said Peter, stung again, this time not by a compliment. \\\"After\\n I got my degree, I went East for a post-graduate training program with\\n an electrical manufacturer. I got quite a bit of experience there. The\\n company\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Stockpiled you,\\\" Lexington said.\\n\\n\\n Peter blinked. \\\"Sir?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Stockpiled you! How much did they pay you?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Not very much, but we were getting the training instead of wages.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Did that come out of the pamphlets they gave you?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Did what come out\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"That guff about receiving training instead of wages!\\\" said Lexington.\\n \\\"Any company that really wants bright trainees will compete for them\\n with money\\u2014cold, hard cash, not platitudes. Maybe you saw a few of\\n their products being made, maybe you didn't. But you're a lot weaker in\\n calculus than when you left school, and in a dozen other subjects too,\\n aren't you?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, nothing we did on the course involved higher mathematics,\\\" Peter\\n admitted cautiously, \\\"and I suppose I could use a refresher course in\\n calculus.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Just as I said\\u2014they stockpiled you, instead of using you as an\\n engineer. They hired you at a cut wage and taught you things that would\\n be useful only in their own company, while in the meantime you were\\n getting weaker in the subjects you'd paid to learn. Or are you one of\\n these birds that had the shot paid for him?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I worked my way through,\\\" said Peter stiffly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"If you'd stayed with them five years, do you think you'd be able to\\n get a job with someone else?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Peter considered his answer carefully. Every man the Association had\\n sent had been turned away. That meant bluffs didn't work. Neither, he'd\\n seen for himself, did allowing himself to be intimidated.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I hadn't thought about it,\\\" he said. \\\"I suppose it wouldn't have been\\n easy.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Impossible, you mean. You wouldn't know a single thing except their\\n procedures, their catalogue numbers, their way of doing things. And\\n you'd have forgotten so much of your engineering training, you'd be\\n scared to take on an engineer's job, for fear you'd be asked to do\\n something you'd forgotten how to do. At that point, they could take you\\n out of the stockpile, put you in just about any job they wanted, at\\n any wage you'd stand for, and they'd have an indentured worker with a\\n degree\\u2014but not the price tag. You see that now?\\\"\\nIt made Peter feel he had been suckered, but he had decided to play\\n this straight all the way. He nodded.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Why'd you leave?\\\" Lexington pursued, unrelenting.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I finished the course and the increase they offered on a permanent\\n basis wasn't enough, so I went elsewhere\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"With your head full of this nonsense about a shortage of engineers.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Peter swallowed. \\\"I thought it would be easier to get a job than it has\\n been, yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"They start the talk about a shortage and then they keep it going. Why?\\n So youngsters will take up engineering thinking they'll wind up among a\\n highly paid minority. You did, didn't you?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes, sir.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"And so did all the others there with you, at school and in this\\n stockpiling outfit?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's right.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well,\\\" said Lexington unexpectedly, \\\"there\\nis\\na shortage! And the\\n stockpiles are the ones who made it, and who keep it going! And the\\n hell of it is that they can't stop\\u2014when one does it, they all have\\n to, or their costs get out of line and they can't compete. What's the\\n solution?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I don't know,\\\" Peter said.\\n\\n\\n Lexington leaned back. \\\"That's quite a lot of admissions you've made.\\n What makes you think you're qualified for the job I'm offering?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You said you wanted an engineer.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"And I've just proved you're less of an engineer than when you left\\n school. I have, haven't I?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"All right, you have,\\\" Peter said angrily.\\n\\n\\n \\\"And now you're wondering why I don't get somebody fresh out of school.\\n Right?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Peter straightened up and met the old man's challenging gaze. \\\"That and\\n whether you're giving me a hard time just for the hell of it.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, am I?\\\" Lexington demanded.\\n\\n\\n Looking at him squarely, seeing the intensity of the pain-drawn eyes,\\n Peter had the startling feeling that Lexington was rooting for him!\\n \\\"No, you're not.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Then what am I after?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Suppose you tell me.\\\"\\n\\n\\n So suddenly that it was almost like a collapse, the tension went out\\n of the old man's face and shoulders. He nodded with inexpressible\\n tiredness. \\\"Good again. The man I want doesn't exist. He has to\\n be made\\u2014the same as I was. You qualify, so far. You've lost your\\n illusions, but haven't had time yet to replace them with dogma or\\n cynicism or bitterness. You saw immediately that fake humility\\n or cockiness wouldn't get you anywhere here, and you were right.\\n Those were the important things. The background data I got from the\\n Association on you counted, of course, but only if you were teachable.\\n I think you are. Am I right?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"At least I can face knowing how much I don't know,\\\" said Peter, \\\"if\\n that answers the question.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It does. Partly. What did you notice about this plant?\\\"\\n\\n\\n In precis form, Peter listed his observations: the absence of windows\\n at sides and rear, the unusual amount of power, the automatic doors,\\n the lack of employees' entrances.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Very good,\\\" said Lexington. \\\"Most people only notice the automatic\\n doors. Anything else?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes,\\\" Peter said. \\\"You're the only person I've seen in the building.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'm the only one there is.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Peter stared his disbelief. Automated plants were nothing new, but\\n they all had their limitations. Either they dealt with exactly similar\\n products or things that could be handled on a flow basis, like oil or\\n water-soluble chemicals. Even these had no more to do than process the\\n goods.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Come on,\\\" said Lexington, getting massively to his feet. \\\"I'll show\\n you.\\\"\\nThe office door opened, and Peter found himself being led down the\\n antiseptic corridor to another door which had opened, giving access to\\n the manufacturing area. As they moved along, between rows of seemingly\\n disorganized machinery, Peter noticed that the factory lights high\\n overhead followed their progress, turning themselves on in advance\\n of their coming, and going out after they had passed, keeping a pool\\n of illumination only in the immediate area they occupied. Soon they\\n reached a large door which Peter recognized as the inside of the truck\\n loading door he had seen from outside.\\n\\n\\n Lexington paused here. \\\"This is the bay used by the trucks arriving\\n with raw materials,\\\" he said. \\\"They back up to this door, and a set\\n of automatic jacks outside lines up the trailer body with the door\\n exactly. Then the door opens and the truck is unloaded by these\\n materials handling machines.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Peter didn't see him touch anything, but as he spoke, three glistening\\n machines, apparently self-powered, rolled noiselessly up to the door in\\n formation and stopped there, apparently waiting to be inspected.\\n\\n\\n They gave Peter the creeps. Simple square boxes, set on casters, with\\n two arms each mounted on the sides might have looked similar. The arms,\\n fashioned much like human arms, hung at the sides, not limply, but in a\\n relaxed position that somehow indicated readiness.\\n\\n\\n Lexington went over to one of them and patted it lovingly. \\\"Really,\\n these machines are only an extension of one large machine. The whole\\n plant, as a matter of fact, is controlled from one point and is really\\n a single unit. These materials handlers, or manipulators, were about\\n the toughest things in the place to design. But they're tremendously\\n useful. You'll see a lot of them around.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Lexington was about to leave the side of the machine when abruptly one\\n of the arms rose to the handkerchief in his breast pocket and daintily\\n tugged it into a more attractive position. It took only a split second,\\n and before Lexington could react, all three machines were moving away\\n to attend to mysterious duties of their own.\\nPeter tore his eyes away from them in time to see the look of\\n frustrated embarrassment that crossed Lexington's face, only to be\\n replaced by one of anger. He said nothing, however, and led Peter to\\n a large bay where racks of steel plate, bar forms, nuts, bolts, and\\n other materials were stored.\\n\\n\\n \\\"After unloading a truck, the machines check the shipment, report any\\n shortages or overages, and store the materials here,\\\" he said, the\\n trace of anger not yet gone from his voice. \\\"When an order is received,\\n it's translated into the catalogue numbers used internally within the\\n plant, and machines like the ones you just saw withdraw the necessary\\n materials from stock, make the component parts, assemble them, and\\n package the finished goods for shipment. Simultaneously, an order is\\n sent to the billing section to bill the customer, and an order is\\n sent to our trucker to come and pick the shipment up. Meanwhile, if\\n the withdrawal of the materials required has depleted our stock, the\\n purchasing section is instructed to order more raw materials. I'll take\\n you through the manufacturing and assembly sections right now, but\\n they're too noisy for me to explain what's going on while we're there.\\\"\\nPeter followed numbly as Lexington led him through a maze of machines,\\n each one seemingly intent on cutting, bending, welding, grinding\\n or carrying some bit of metal, or just standing idle, waiting for\\n something to do. The two-armed manipulators Peter had just seen were\\n everywhere, scuttling from machine to machine, apparently with an\\n exact knowledge of what they were doing and the most efficient way of\\n doing it.\\n\\n\\n He wondered what would happen if one of them tried to use the same\\n aisle they were using. He pictured a futile attempt to escape the\\n onrushing wheels, saw himself clambering out of the path of the\\n speeding vehicle just in time to fall into the jaws of the punch press\\n that was laboring beside him at the moment. Nervously, he looked for an\\n exit, but his apprehension was unnecessary. The machines seemed to know\\n where they were and avoided the two men, or stopped to wait for them to\\n go by.\\n\\n\\n Back in the office section of the building, Lexington indicated a small\\n room where a typewriter could be heard clattering away. \\\"Standard\\n business machines, operated by the central control mechanism. In\\n that room,\\\" he said, as the door swung open and Peter saw that the\\n typewriter was actually a sort of teletype, with no one before the\\n keyboard, \\\"incoming mail is sorted and inquiries are replied to. In\\n this one over here, purchase orders are prepared, and across the hall\\n there's a very similar rig set up in conjunction with an automatic\\n bookkeeper to keep track of the pennies and to bill the customers.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Then all you do is read the incoming mail and maintain the machinery?\\\"\\n asked Peter, trying to shake off the feeling of open amazement that\\n had engulfed him.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I don't even do those things, except for a few letters that come in\\n every week that\\u2014it doesn't want to deal with by itself.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The shock of what he had just seen was showing plainly on Peter's face\\n when they walked back into Lexington's office and sat down. Lexington\\n looked at him for quite a while without saying anything, his face\\n sagging and pale. Peter didn't trust himself to speak, and let the\\n silence remain unbroken.\\n\\n\\n Finally Lexington spoke. \\\"I know it's hard to believe, but there it is.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Hard to believe?\\\" said Peter. \\\"I almost can't. The trade journals run\\n articles about factories like this one, but planned for ten, maybe\\n twenty years in the future.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Damn fools!\\\" exclaimed Lexington, getting part of his breath back.\\n \\\"They could have had it years ago, if they'd been willing to drop their\\n idiotic notions about specialization.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Lexington mopped his forehead with a large white handkerchief.\\n Apparently the walk through the factory had tired him considerably,\\n although it hadn't been strenuous.\\nHe leaned back in his chair and began to talk in a low voice completely\\n in contrast with the overbearing manner he had used upon Peter's\\n arrival. \\\"You know what we make, of course.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes, sir. Conduit fittings.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"And a lot of other electrical products, too. I started out in this\\n business twenty years ago, using orthodox techniques. I never got\\n through university. I took a couple of years of an arts course, and\\n got so interested in biology that I didn't study anything else.\\n They bounced me out of the course, and I re-entered in engineering,\\n determined not to make the same mistake again. But I did. I got too\\n absorbed in those parts of the course that had to do with electrical\\n theory and lost the rest as a result. The same thing happened when I\\n tried commerce, with accounting, so I gave up and started working for\\n one of my competitors. It wasn't too long before I saw that the only\\n way I could get ahead was to open up on my own.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Lexington sank deeper in his chair and stared at the ceiling as he\\n spoke. \\\"I put myself in hock to the eyeballs, which wasn't easy,\\n because I had just got married, and started off in a very small way.\\n After three years, I had a fairly decent little business going, and I\\n suppose it would have grown just like any other business, except for\\n a strike that came along and put me right back where I started. My\\n wife, whom I'm afraid I had neglected for the sake of the business,\\n was killed in a car accident about then, and rightly or wrongly, that\\n made me angrier with the union than anything else. If the union hadn't\\n made things so tough for me from the beginning, I'd have had more time\\n to spend with my wife before her death. As things turned out\\u2014well, I\\n remember looking down at her coffin and thinking that I hardly knew the\\n girl.\\n\\n\\n \\\"For the next few years, I concentrated on getting rid of as many\\n employees as I could, by replacing them with automatic machines. I'd\\n design the control circuits myself, in many cases wire the things up\\n myself, always concentrating on replacing men with machines. But it\\n wasn't very successful. I found that the more automatic I made my\\n plant, the lower my costs went. The lower my costs went, the more\\n business I got, and the more I had to expand.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Lexington scowled. \\\"I got sick of it. I decided to try developing one\\n multi-purpose control circuit that would control everything, from\\n ordering the raw materials to shipping the finished goods. As I told\\n you, I had taken quite an interest in biology when I was in school,\\n and from studies of nerve tissue in particular, plus my electrical\\n knowledge, I had a few ideas on how to do it. It took me three years,\\n but I began to see that I could develop circuitry that could remember,\\n compare, detect similarities, and so on. Not the way they do it today,\\n of course. To do what I wanted to do with these big clumsy magnetic\\n drums, tapes, and what-not, you'd need a building the size of Mount\\n Everest. But I found that I could let organic chemistry do most of the\\n work for me.\\n\\n\\n \\\"By creating the proper compounds, with their molecules arranged in\\n predetermined matrixes, I found I could duplicate electrical circuitry\\n in units so tiny that my biggest problem was getting into and out of\\n the logic units with conventional wiring. I finally beat that the same\\n way they solved the problem of translating a picture on a screen into\\n electrical signals, developed equipment to scan the units cyclically,\\n and once I'd done that, the battle was over.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I built this building and incorporated it as a separate company, to\\n compete with my first outfit. In the beginning, I had it rigged up to\\n do only the manual work that you saw being done a few minutes ago in\\n the back of this place. I figured that the best thing for me to do\\n would be to turn the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers, leaving\\n me free to do nothing except receive orders, punch the catalogue\\n numbers into the control console, do the billing, and collect the\\n money.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"What happened to your original company?\\\" Peter asked.\\nLexington smiled. \\\"Well, automated as it was, it couldn't compete with\\n this plant. It gave me great pleasure, three years after this one\\n started working, to see my old company go belly up. This company bought\\n the old firm's equipment for next to nothing and I wound up with all my\\n assets, but only one employee\\u2014me.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I thought everything would be rosy from that point on, but it\\n wasn't. I found that I couldn't keep up with the mail unless I worked\\n impossible hours. I added a couple of new pieces of equipment to the\\n control section. One was simply a huge memory bank. The other was\\n a comparator circuit. A complicated one, but a comparator circuit\\n nevertheless. Here I was working on instinct more than anything. I\\n figured that if I interconnected these circuits in such a way that\\n they could sense everything that went on in the plant, and compare one\\n action with another, by and by the unit would be able to see patterns.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Then, through the existing command output, I figured these new units\\n would be able to control the plant, continuing the various patterns of\\n activity that I'd already established.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Here Lexington frowned. \\\"It didn't work worth a damn! It just sat there\\n and did nothing. I couldn't understand it for the longest time, and\\n then I realized what the trouble was. I put a kicker circuit into it, a\\n sort of voltage-bias network. I reset the equipment so that while it\\n was still under instructions to receive orders and produce goods, its\\n prime purpose was to activate the kicker. The kicker, however, could\\n only be activated by me, manually. Lastly, I set up one of the early\\n TV pickups over the mail slitter and allowed every letter I received,\\n every order, to be fed into the memory banks. That did it.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I\\u2014I don't understand,\\\" stammered Peter.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Simple! Whenever I was pleased that things were going smoothly, I\\n pressed the kicker button. The machine had one purpose, so far as its\\n logic circuits were concerned. Its object was to get me to press that\\n button. Every day I'd press it at the same time, unless things weren't\\n going well. If there had been trouble in the shop, I'd press it late,\\n or maybe not at all. If all the orders were out on schedule, or ahead\\n of time, I'd press it ahead of time, or maybe twice in the same day.\\n Pretty soon the machine got the idea.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'll never forget the day I picked up an incoming order form from one\\n of the western jobbers, and found that the keyboard was locked when I\\n tried to punch it into the control console. It completely baffled me\\n at first. Then, while I was tracing out the circuits to see if I could\\n discover what was holding the keyboard lock in, I noticed that the\\n order was already entered on the in-progress list. I was a long time\\n convincing myself that it had really happened, but there was no other\\n explanation.\\n\\n\\n \\\"The machine had realized that whenever one of those forms came in, I\\n copied the list of goods from it onto the in-progress list through the\\n console keyboard, thus activating the producing mechanisms in the back\\n of the plant. The machine had done it for me this time, then locked the\\n keyboard so I couldn't enter the order twice. I think I held down the\\n kicker button for a full five minutes that day.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"This kicker button,\\\" Peter said tentatively, \\\"it's like the pleasure\\n center in an animal's brain, isn't it?\\\"\\nWhen Lexington beamed, Peter felt a surge of relief. Talking with this\\n man was like walking a tightrope. A word too much or a word too little\\n might mean the difference between getting the job or losing it.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Exactly!\\\" whispered Lexington, in an almost conspiratorial tone. \\\"I\\n had altered the circuitry of the machine so that it tried to give\\n me pleasure\\u2014because by doing so, its own pleasure circuit would be\\n activated.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Things went fast from then on. Once I realized that the machine\\n was learning, I put TV monitors all over the place, so the machine\\n could watch everything that was going on. After a short while I had\\n to increase the memory bank, and later I increased it again, but the\\n rewards were worth it. Soon, by watching what I did, and then by doing\\n it for me next time it had to be done, the machine had learned to do\\n almost everything, and I had time to sit back and count my winnings.\\\"\\n\\n\\n At this point the door opened, and a small self-propelled cart wheeled\\n silently into the room. Stopping in front of Peter, it waited until he\\n had taken a small plate laden with two or three cakes off its surface.\\n Then the soft, evenly modulated voice he had heard before asked, \\\"How\\n do you like your coffee? Cream, sugar, both or black?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Peter looked for the speaker in the side of the cart, saw nothing, and\\n replied, feeling slightly silly as he did so, \\\"Black, please.\\\"\\n\\n\\n A square hole appeared in the top of the cart, like the elevator hole\\n in an aircraft carrier's deck. When the section of the cart's surface\\n rose again, a fine china cup containing steaming black coffee rested\\n on it.

Then\\n he continued with his narrative. \\\"I suppose it's all my own fault. I\\n didn't detect the symptoms soon enough. After this plant got working\\n properly, I started living here. It wasn't a question of saving money.\\n I hated to waste two hours a day driving to and from my house, and I\\n also wanted to be on hand in case anything should go wrong that the\\n machine couldn't fix for itself.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Handling the cup as if it were going to shatter at any moment, he took\\n a gulp. \\\"I began to see that the machine could understand the written\\n word, and I tried hooking a teletype directly into the logic circuits.\\n It was like uncorking a seltzer bottle. The machine had a funny\\n vocabulary\\u2014all of it gleaned from letters it had seen coming in, and\\n replies it had seen leaving. But it was intelligible. It even displayed\\n some traces of the personality the machine was acquiring.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It had chosen a name for itself, for instance\\u2014'Lex.' That shook me.\\n You might think Lex Industries was named through an abbreviation of\\n the name Lexington, but it wasn't. My wife's name was Alexis, and it\\n was named after the nickname she always used. I objected, of course,\\n but how can you object on a point like that to a machine? Bear in mind\\n that I had to be careful to behave reasonably at all times, because the\\n machine was still learning from me, and I was afraid that any tantrums\\n I threw might be imitated.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It sounds pretty awkward,\\\" Peter put in.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You don't know the half of it! As time went on, I had less and less to\\n do, and business-wise I found that the entire control of the operation\\n was slipping from my grasp. Many times I discovered\\u2014too late\\u2014that\\n the machine had taken the damnedest risks you ever saw on bids and\\n contracts for supply. It was quoting impossible delivery times on\\n some orders, and charging pirate's prices on others, all without any\\n obvious reason. Inexplicably, we always came out on top. It would turn\\n out that on the short-delivery-time quotations, we'd been up against\\n stiff competition, and cutting the production time was the only way we\\n could get the order. On the high-priced quotes, I'd find that no one\\n else was bidding. We were making more money than I'd ever dreamed of,\\n and to make it still better, I'd find that for months I had virtually\\n nothing to do.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It sounds wonderful, sir,\\\" said Peter, feeling dazzled.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It was, in a way. I remember one day I was especially pleased with\\n something, and I went to the control console to give the kicker button\\n a long, hard push.

T. HAGGERT\\n\\n\\n Illustrated by WOOD\\n\\n\\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\\n\\n Galaxy Magazine August 1959.\\n\\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\\n\\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\\nNothing in the world could be happier and\\n \\nmere serene than a man who loves his work\\u2014but\\n \\nwhat happens when it loves him back?\\nKeep your nerve, Peter Manners told himself; it's only a job. But nerve\\n has to rest on a sturdier foundation than cash reserves just above zero\\n and eviction if he came away from this interview still unemployed.\\n Clay, at the Association of Professional Engineers, who had set up the\\n appointment, hadn't eased Peter's nervousness by admitting, \\\"I don't\\n know what in hell he's looking for. He's turned down every man we've\\n sent him.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The interview was at three. Fifteen minutes to go. Coming early would\\n betray overeagerness. Peter stood in front of the Lex Industries plant\\n and studied it to kill time. Plain, featureless concrete walls, not\\n large for a manufacturing plant\\u2014it took a scant minute to exhaust its\\n sightseeing potential. If he walked around the building, he could, if\\n he ambled, come back to the front entrance just before three.\\n\\n\\n He turned the corner, stopped, frowned, wondering what there was about\\n the building that seemed so puzzling. It could not have been plainer,\\n more ordinary. It was in fact, he only gradually realized, so plain and\\n ordinary that it was like no other building he had ever seen.\\n\\n\\n There had been windows at the front. There were none at the side, and\\n none at the rear. Then how were the working areas lit? He looked for\\n the electric service lines and found them at one of the rear corners.\\n They jolted him. The distribution transformers were ten times as large\\n as they should have been for a plant this size.\\n\\n\\n Something else was wrong. Peter looked for minutes before he found out\\n what it was. Factories usually have large side doorways for employees\\n changing shifts. This building had one small office entrance facing the\\n street, and the only other door was at the loading bay\\u2014big enough to\\n handle employee traffic, but four feet above the ground. Without any\\n stairs, it could be used only by trucks backing up to it. Maybe the\\n employees' entrance was on the third side.\\n\\n\\n It wasn't.\\nStaring back at the last blank wall, Peter suddenly remembered the time\\n he had set out to kill. He looked at his watch and gasped. At a run,\\n set to straight-arm the door, he almost fell on his face. The door had\\n opened by itself. He stopped and looked for a photo-electric eye, but\\n a soft voice said through a loudspeaker in the anteroom wall: \\\"Mr.\\n Manners?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"What?\\\" he panted. \\\"Who\\u2014?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You\\nare\\nMr. Manners?\\\" the voice asked.\\n\\n\\n He nodded, then realized he had to answer aloud if there was a\\n microphone around; but the soft voice said: \\\"Follow the open doors down\\n the hall. Mr. Lexington is expecting you.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Thanks,\\\" Peter said, and a door at one side of the anteroom swung open\\n for him.\\n\\n\\n He went through it with his composure slipping still further from his\\n grip. This was no way to go into an interview, but doors kept opening\\n before and shutting after him, until only one was left, and the last of\\n his calm was blasted away by a bellow from within.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Don't stand out there like a jackass! Either come in or go away!\\\"\\n\\n\\n Peter found himself leaping obediently toward the doorway. He stopped\\n just short of it, took a deep breath and huffed it out, took another,\\n all the while thinking, Hold on now; you're in no shape for an\\n interview\\u2014and it's not your fault\\u2014this whole setup is geared to\\n unnerve you: the kindergarten kid called in to see the principal.\\n\\n\\n He let another bellow bounce off him as he blew out the second breath,\\n straightened his jacket and tie, and walked in as an engineer applying\\n for a position should.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Mr. Lexington?\\\" he said. \\\"I'm Peter Manners. The Association\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Sit down,\\\" said the man at the desk. \\\"Let's look you over.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He was a huge man behind an even huger desk. Peter took a chair in\\n front of the desk and let himself be inspected. It wasn't comfortable.\\n He did some looking over of his own to ease the tension.\\n\\n\\n The room was more than merely large, carpeted throughout with\\n a high-pile, rich, sound-deadening rug. The oversized desk and\\n massive leather chairs, heavy patterned drapes, ornately framed\\n paintings\\u2014by God, even a glass-brick manteled fireplace and bowls with\\n flowers!\\u2014made him feel as if he had walked down a hospital corridor\\n into Hollywood's idea of an office.\\n\\n\\n His eyes eventually had to move to Lexington, and they were daunted\\n for another instant. This was a citadel of a man\\u2014great girders of\\n frame supporting buttresses of muscle\\u2014with a vaulting head and\\n drawbridge chin and a steel gaze that defied any attempt to storm it.\\n\\n\\n But then Peter came out of his momentary flinch, and there was an age\\n to the man, about 65, and he saw the muscles had turned to fat, the\\n complexion ashen, the eyes set deep as though retreating from pain, and\\n this was a citadel of a man, yes, but beginning to crumble.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What can you do?\\\" asked Lexington abruptly.\\nPeter started, opened his mouth to answer, closed it again. He'd been\\n jolted too often in too short a time to be stampeded into blurting a\\n reply that would cost him this job.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Good,\\\" said Lexington. \\\"Only a fool would try to answer that. Do you\\n have any knowledge of medicine?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Not enough to matter,\\\" Peter said, stung by the compliment.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I don't mean how to bandage a cut or splint a broken arm. I mean\\n things like cell structure, neural communication\\u2014the\\nbasics\\nof how\\n we live.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'm applying for a job as engineer.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I know. Are you interested in the basics of how we live?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Peter looked for a hidden trap, found none. \\\"Of course. Isn't everyone?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Less than you think,\\\" Lexington said. \\\"It's the preconceived notions\\n they're interested in protecting. At least I won't have to beat them\\n out of you.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Thanks,\\\" said Peter, and waited for the next fast ball.\\n\\n\\n \\\"How long have you been out of school?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Only two years. But you knew that from the Association\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"No practical experience to speak of?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Some,\\\" said Peter, stung again, this time not by a compliment. \\\"After\\n I got my degree, I went East for a post-graduate training program with\\n an electrical manufacturer. I got quite a bit of experience there. The\\n company\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Stockpiled you,\\\" Lexington said.\\n\\n\\n Peter blinked. \\\"Sir?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Stockpiled you! How much did they pay you?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Not very much, but we were getting the training instead of wages.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Did that come out of the pamphlets they gave you?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Did what come out\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"That guff about receiving training instead of wages!\\\" said Lexington.\\n \\\"Any company that really wants bright trainees will compete for them\\n with money\\u2014cold, hard cash, not platitudes. Maybe you saw a few of\\n their products being made, maybe you didn't. But you're a lot weaker in\\n calculus than when you left school, and in a dozen other subjects too,\\n aren't you?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, nothing we did on the course involved higher mathematics,\\\" Peter\\n admitted cautiously, \\\"and I suppose I could use a refresher course in\\n calculus.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Just as I said\\u2014they stockpiled you, instead of using you as an\\n engineer. They hired you at a cut wage and taught you things that would\\n be useful only in their own company, while in the meantime you were\\n getting weaker in the subjects you'd paid to learn. Or are you one of\\n these birds that had the shot paid for him?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I worked my way through,\\\" said Peter stiffly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"If you'd stayed with them five years, do you think you'd be able to\\n get a job with someone else?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Peter considered his answer carefully. Every man the Association had\\n sent had been turned away. That meant bluffs didn't work. Neither, he'd\\n seen for himself, did allowing himself to be intimidated.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I hadn't thought about it,\\\" he said. \\\"I suppose it wouldn't have been\\n easy.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Impossible, you mean. You wouldn't know a single thing except their\\n procedures, their catalogue numbers, their way of doing things. And\\n you'd have forgotten so much of your engineering training, you'd be\\n scared to take on an engineer's job, for fear you'd be asked to do\\n something you'd forgotten how to do. At that point, they could take you\\n out of the stockpile, put you in just about any job they wanted, at\\n any wage you'd stand for, and they'd have an indentured worker with a\\n degree\\u2014but not the price tag. You see that now?\\\"\\nIt made Peter feel he had been suckered, but he had decided to play\\n this straight all the way. He nodded.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Why'd you leave?\\\" Lexington pursued, unrelenting.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I finished the course and the increase they offered on a permanent\\n basis wasn't enough, so I went elsewhere\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"With your head full of this nonsense about a shortage of engineers.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Peter swallowed. \\\"I thought it would be easier to get a job than it has\\n been, yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"They start the talk about a shortage and then they keep it going. Why?\\n So youngsters will take up engineering thinking they'll wind up among a\\n highly paid minority. You did, didn't you?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes, sir.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"And so did all the others there with you, at school and in this\\n stockpiling outfit?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's right.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well,\\\" said Lexington unexpectedly, \\\"there\\nis\\na shortage! And the\\n stockpiles are the ones who made it, and who keep it going! And the\\n hell of it is that they can't stop\\u2014when one does it, they all have\\n to, or their costs get out of line and they can't compete. What's the\\n solution?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I don't know,\\\" Peter said.\\n\\n\\n Lexington leaned back. \\\"That's quite a lot of admissions you've made.\\n What makes you think you're qualified for the job I'm offering?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You said you wanted an engineer.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"And I've just proved you're less of an engineer than when you left\\n school. I have, haven't I?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"All right, you have,\\\" Peter said angrily.\\n\\n\\n \\\"And now you're wondering why I don't get somebody fresh out of school.\\n Right?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Peter straightened up and met the old man's challenging gaze. \\\"That and\\n whether you're giving me a hard time just for the hell of it.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, am I?\\\" Lexington demanded.\\n\\n\\n Looking at him squarely, seeing the intensity of the pain-drawn eyes,\\n Peter had the startling feeling that Lexington was rooting for him!\\n \\\"No, you're not.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Then what am I after?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Suppose you tell me.\\\"\\n\\n\\n So suddenly that it was almost like a collapse, the tension went out\\n of the old man's face and shoulders. He nodded with inexpressible\\n tiredness. \\\"Good again. The man I want doesn't exist. He has to\\n be made\\u2014the same as I was. You qualify, so far. You've lost your\\n illusions, but haven't had time yet to replace them with dogma or\\n cynicism or bitterness. You saw immediately that fake humility\\n or cockiness wouldn't get you anywhere here, and you were right.\\n Those were the important things. The background data I got from the\\n Association on you counted, of course, but only if you were teachable.\\n I think you are. Am I right?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"At least I can face knowing how much I don't know,\\\" said Peter, \\\"if\\n that answers the question.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It does. Partly. What did you notice about this plant?\\\"\\n\\n\\n In precis form, Peter listed his observations: the absence of windows\\n at sides and rear, the unusual amount of power, the automatic doors,\\n the lack of employees' entrances.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Very good,\\\" said Lexington. \\\"Most people only notice the automatic\\n doors. Anything else?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes,\\\" Peter said. \\\"You're the only person I've seen in the building.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'm the only one there is.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Peter stared his disbelief. Automated plants were nothing new, but\\n they all had their limitations. Either they dealt with exactly similar\\n products or things that could be handled on a flow basis, like oil or\\n water-soluble chemicals. Even these had no more to do than process the\\n goods.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Come on,\\\" said Lexington, getting massively to his feet. \\\"I'll show\\n you.\\\"\\nThe office door opened, and Peter found himself being led down the\\n antiseptic corridor to another door which had opened, giving access to\\n the manufacturing area. As they moved along, between rows of seemingly\\n disorganized machinery, Peter noticed that the factory lights high\\n overhead followed their progress, turning themselves on in advance\\n of their coming, and going out after they had passed, keeping a pool\\n of illumination only in the immediate area they occupied. Soon they\\n reached a large door which Peter recognized as the inside of the truck\\n loading door he had seen from outside.\\n\\n\\n Lexington paused here. \\\"This is the bay used by the trucks arriving\\n with raw materials,\\\" he said. \\\"They back up to this door, and a set\\n of automatic jacks outside lines up the trailer body with the door\\n exactly. Then the door opens and the truck is unloaded by these\\n materials handling machines.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Peter didn't see him touch anything, but as he spoke, three glistening\\n machines, apparently self-powered, rolled noiselessly up to the door in\\n formation and stopped there, apparently waiting to be inspected.\\n\\n\\n They gave Peter the creeps. Simple square boxes, set on casters, with\\n two arms each mounted on the sides might have looked similar. The arms,\\n fashioned much like human arms, hung at the sides, not limply, but in a\\n relaxed position that somehow indicated readiness.\\n\\n\\n Lexington went over to one of them and patted it lovingly. \\\"Really,\\n these machines are only an extension of one large machine. The whole\\n plant, as a matter of fact, is controlled from one point and is really\\n a single unit. These materials handlers, or manipulators, were about\\n the toughest things in the place to design. But they're tremendously\\n useful. You'll see a lot of them around.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Lexington was about to leave the side of the machine when abruptly one\\n of the arms rose to the handkerchief in his breast pocket and daintily\\n tugged it into a more attractive position. It took only a split second,\\n and before Lexington could react, all three machines were moving away\\n to attend to mysterious duties of their own.\\nPeter tore his eyes away from them in time to see the look of\\n frustrated embarrassment that crossed Lexington's face, only to be\\n replaced by one of anger. He said nothing, however, and led Peter to\\n a large bay where racks of steel plate, bar forms, nuts, bolts, and\\n other materials were stored.\\n\\n\\n \\\"After unloading a truck, the machines check the shipment, report any\\n shortages or overages, and store the materials here,\\\" he said, the\\n trace of anger not yet gone from his voice. \\\"When an order is received,\\n it's translated into the catalogue numbers used internally within the\\n plant, and machines like the ones you just saw withdraw the necessary\\n materials from stock, make the component parts, assemble them, and\\n package the finished goods for shipment. Simultaneously, an order is\\n sent to the billing section to bill the customer, and an order is\\n sent to our trucker to come and pick the shipment up. Meanwhile, if\\n the withdrawal of the materials required has depleted our stock, the\\n purchasing section is instructed to order more raw materials. I'll take\\n you through the manufacturing and assembly sections right now, but\\n they're too noisy for me to explain what's going on while we're there.\\\"\\nPeter followed numbly as Lexington led him through a maze of machines,\\n each one seemingly intent on cutting, bending, welding, grinding\\n or carrying some bit of metal, or just standing idle, waiting for\\n something to do. The two-armed manipulators Peter had just seen were\\n everywhere, scuttling from machine to machine, apparently with an\\n exact knowledge of what they were doing and the most efficient way of\\n doing it.\\n\\n\\n He wondered what would happen if one of them tried to use the same\\n aisle they were using. He pictured a futile attempt to escape the\\n onrushing wheels, saw himself clambering out of the path of the\\n speeding vehicle just in time to fall into the jaws of the punch press\\n that was laboring beside him at the moment. Nervously, he looked for an\\n exit, but his apprehension was unnecessary. The machines seemed to know\\n where they were and avoided the two men, or stopped to wait for them to\\n go by.\\n\\n\\n Back in the office section of the building, Lexington indicated a small\\n room where a typewriter could be heard clattering away. \\\"Standard\\n business machines, operated by the central control mechanism. In\\n that room,\\\" he said, as the door swung open and Peter saw that the\\n typewriter was actually a sort of teletype, with no one before the\\n keyboard, \\\"incoming mail is sorted and inquiries are replied to. In\\n this one over here, purchase orders are prepared, and across the hall\\n there's a very similar rig set up in conjunction with an automatic\\n bookkeeper to keep track of the pennies and to bill the customers.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Then all you do is read the incoming mail and maintain the machinery?\\\"\\n asked Peter, trying to shake off the feeling of open amazement that\\n had engulfed him.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I don't even do those things, except for a few letters that come in\\n every week that\\u2014it doesn't want to deal with by itself.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The shock of what he had just seen was showing plainly on Peter's face\\n when they walked back into Lexington's office and sat down. Lexington\\n looked at him for quite a while without saying anything, his face\\n sagging and pale. Peter didn't trust himself to speak, and let the\\n silence remain unbroken.\\n\\n\\n Finally Lexington spoke. \\\"I know it's hard to believe, but there it is.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Hard to believe?\\\" said Peter. \\\"I almost can't. The trade journals run\\n articles about factories like this one, but planned for ten, maybe\\n twenty years in the future.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Damn fools!\\\" exclaimed Lexington, getting part of his breath back.\\n \\\"They could have had it years ago, if they'd been willing to drop their\\n idiotic notions about specialization.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Lexington mopped his forehead with a large white handkerchief.\\n Apparently the walk through the factory had tired him considerably,\\n although it hadn't been strenuous.\\nHe leaned back in his chair and began to talk in a low voice completely\\n in contrast with the overbearing manner he had used upon Peter's\\n arrival. \\\"You know what we make, of course.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes, sir. Conduit fittings.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"And a lot of other electrical products, too. I started out in this\\n business twenty years ago, using orthodox techniques. I never got\\n through university. I took a couple of years of an arts course, and\\n got so interested in biology that I didn't study anything else.\\n They bounced me out of the course, and I re-entered in engineering,\\n determined not to make the same mistake again. But I did. I got too\\n absorbed in those parts of the course that had to do with electrical\\n theory and lost the rest as a result. The same thing happened when I\\n tried commerce, with accounting, so I gave up and started working for\\n one of my competitors. It wasn't too long before I saw that the only\\n way I could get ahead was to open up on my own.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Lexington sank deeper in his chair and stared at the ceiling as he\\n spoke. \\\"I put myself in hock to the eyeballs, which wasn't easy,\\n because I had just got married, and started off in a very small way.\\n After three years, I had a fairly decent little business going, and I\\n suppose it would have grown just like any other business, except for\\n a strike that came along and put me right back where I started. My\\n wife, whom I'm afraid I had neglected for the sake of the business,\\n was killed in a car accident about then, and rightly or wrongly, that\\n made me angrier with the union than anything else. If the union hadn't\\n made things so tough for me from the beginning, I'd have had more time\\n to spend with my wife before her death. As things turned out\\u2014well, I\\n remember looking down at her coffin and thinking that I hardly knew the\\n girl.\\n\\n\\n \\\"For the next few years, I concentrated on getting rid of as many\\n employees as I could, by replacing them with automatic machines. I'd\\n design the control circuits myself, in many cases wire the things up\\n myself, always concentrating on replacing men with machines. But it\\n wasn't very successful. I found that the more automatic I made my\\n plant, the lower my costs went. The lower my costs went, the more\\n business I got, and the more I had to expand.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Lexington scowled. \\\"I got sick of it. I decided to try developing one\\n multi-purpose control circuit that would control everything, from\\n ordering the raw materials to shipping the finished goods. As I told\\n you, I had taken quite an interest in biology when I was in school,\\n and from studies of nerve tissue in particular, plus my electrical\\n knowledge, I had a few ideas on how to do it. It took me three years,\\n but I began to see that I could develop circuitry that could remember,\\n compare, detect similarities, and so on. Not the way they do it today,\\n of course. To do what I wanted to do with these big clumsy magnetic\\n drums, tapes, and what-not, you'd need a building the size of Mount\\n Everest. But I found that I could let organic chemistry do most of the\\n work for me.\\n\\n\\n \\\"By creating the proper compounds, with their molecules arranged in\\n predetermined matrixes, I found I could duplicate electrical circuitry\\n in units so tiny that my biggest problem was getting into and out of\\n the logic units with conventional wiring. I finally beat that the same\\n way they solved the problem of translating a picture on a screen into\\n electrical signals, developed equipment to scan the units cyclically,\\n and once I'd done that, the battle was over.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I built this building and incorporated it as a separate company, to\\n compete with my first outfit. In the beginning, I had it rigged up to\\n do only the manual work that you saw being done a few minutes ago in\\n the back of this place. I figured that the best thing for me to do\\n would be to turn the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers, leaving\\n me free to do nothing except receive orders, punch the catalogue\\n numbers into the control console, do the billing, and collect the\\n money.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"What happened to your original company?\\\" Peter asked.\\nLexington smiled. \\\"Well, automated as it was, it couldn't compete with\\n this plant. It gave me great pleasure, three years after this one\\n started working, to see my old company go belly up. This company bought\\n the old firm's equipment for next to nothing and I wound up with all my\\n assets, but only one employee\\u2014me.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I thought everything would be rosy from that point on, but it\\n wasn't. I found that I couldn't keep up with the mail unless I worked\\n impossible hours. I added a couple of new pieces of equipment to the\\n control section. One was simply a huge memory bank. The other was\\n a comparator circuit. A complicated one, but a comparator circuit\\n nevertheless. Here I was working on instinct more than anything. I\\n figured that if I interconnected these circuits in such a way that\\n they could sense everything that went on in the plant, and compare one\\n action with another, by and by the unit would be able to see patterns.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Then, through the existing command output, I figured these new units\\n would be able to control the plant, continuing the various patterns of\\n activity that I'd already established.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Here Lexington frowned. \\\"It didn't work worth a damn! It just sat there\\n and did nothing. I couldn't understand it for the longest time, and\\n then I realized what the trouble was. I put a kicker circuit into it, a\\n sort of voltage-bias network. I reset the equipment so that while it\\n was still under instructions to receive orders and produce goods, its\\n prime purpose was to activate the kicker. The kicker, however, could\\n only be activated by me, manually. Lastly, I set up one of the early\\n TV pickups over the mail slitter and allowed every letter I received,\\n every order, to be fed into the memory banks. That did it.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I\\u2014I don't understand,\\\" stammered Peter.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Simple! Whenever I was pleased that things were going smoothly, I\\n pressed the kicker button. The machine had one purpose, so far as its\\n logic circuits were concerned. Its object was to get me to press that\\n button. Every day I'd press it at the same time, unless things weren't\\n going well. If there had been trouble in the shop, I'd press it late,\\n or maybe not at all. If all the orders were out on schedule, or ahead\\n of time, I'd press it ahead of time, or maybe twice in the same day.\\n Pretty soon the machine got the idea.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'll never forget the day I picked up an incoming order form from one\\n of the western jobbers, and found that the keyboard was locked when I\\n tried to punch it into the control console. It completely baffled me\\n at first. Then, while I was tracing out the circuits to see if I could\\n discover what was holding the keyboard lock in, I noticed that the\\n order was already entered on the in-progress list. I was a long time\\n convincing myself that it had really happened, but there was no other\\n explanation.\\n\\n\\n \\\"The machine had realized that whenever one of those forms came in, I\\n copied the list of goods from it onto the in-progress list through the\\n console keyboard, thus activating the producing mechanisms in the back\\n of the plant. The machine had done it for me this time, then locked the\\n keyboard so I couldn't enter the order twice. I think I held down the\\n kicker button for a full five minutes that day.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"This kicker button,\\\" Peter said tentatively, \\\"it's like the pleasure\\n center in an animal's brain, isn't it?\\\"\\nWhen Lexington beamed, Peter felt a surge of relief. Talking with this\\n man was like walking a tightrope. A word too much or a word too little\\n might mean the difference between getting the job or losing it.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Exactly!\\\" whispered Lexington, in an almost conspiratorial tone. \\\"I\\n had altered the circuitry of the machine so that it tried to give\\n me pleasure\\u2014because by doing so, its own pleasure circuit would be\\n activated.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Things went fast from then on. Once I realized that the machine\\n was learning, I put TV monitors all over the place, so the machine\\n could watch everything that was going on. After a short while I had\\n to increase the memory bank, and later I increased it again, but the\\n rewards were worth it. Soon, by watching what I did, and then by doing\\n it for me next time it had to be done, the machine had learned to do\\n almost everything, and I had time to sit back and count my winnings.\\\"\\n\\n\\n At this point the door opened, and a small self-propelled cart wheeled\\n silently into the room. Stopping in front of Peter, it waited until he\\n had taken a small plate laden with two or three cakes off its surface.\\n Then the soft, evenly modulated voice he had heard before asked, \\\"How\\n do you like your coffee? Cream, sugar, both or black?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Peter looked for the speaker in the side of the cart, saw nothing, and\\n replied, feeling slightly silly as he did so, \\\"Black, please.\\\"\\n\\n\\n A square hole appeared in the top of the cart, like the elevator hole\\n in an aircraft carrier's deck. When the section of the cart's surface\\n rose again, a fine china cup containing steaming black coffee rested\\n on it. Peter took it and sipped it, as he supposed he was expected to\\n do, while the cart proceeded over to Lexington's desk. Once there, it\\n stopped again, and another cup of coffee rose to its surface.\\nLexington took the coffee from the top of the car, obviously angry\\n about something. Silently, he waited until the cart had left the\\n office, then snapped, \\\"Look at those bloody cups!\\\"\\n\\n\\n Peter looked at his, which was eggshell thin, fluted with carving and\\n ornately covered with gold leaf. \\\"They look very expensive,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Not only expensive, but stupid and impractical!\\\" exploded Lexington.\\n \\\"They only hold half a cup, they'll break at a touch, every one has to\\n be matched with its own saucer, and if you use them for any length of\\n time, the gold leaf comes off!\\\"\\n\\n\\n Peter searched for a comment, found none that fitted this odd outburst,\\n so he kept silent.\\nLexington stared at his cup without touching it for a long while. Then\\n he continued with his narrative. \\\"I suppose it's all my own fault. I\\n didn't detect the symptoms soon enough. After this plant got working\\n properly, I started living here. It wasn't a question of saving money.\\n I hated to waste two hours a day driving to and from my house, and I\\n also wanted to be on hand in case anything should go wrong that the\\n machine couldn't fix for itself.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Handling the cup as if it were going to shatter at any moment, he took\\n a gulp. \\\"I began to see that the machine could understand the written\\n word, and I tried hooking a teletype directly into the logic circuits.\\n It was like uncorking a seltzer bottle. The machine had a funny\\n vocabulary\\u2014all of it gleaned from letters it had seen coming in, and\\n replies it had seen leaving. But it was intelligible. It even displayed\\n some traces of the personality the machine was acquiring.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It had chosen a name for itself, for instance\\u2014'Lex.' That shook me.\\n You might think Lex Industries was named through an abbreviation of\\n the name Lexington, but it wasn't. My wife's name was Alexis, and it\\n was named after the nickname she always used. I objected, of course,\\n but how can you object on a point like that to a machine? Bear in mind\\n that I had to be careful to behave reasonably at all times, because the\\n machine was still learning from me, and I was afraid that any tantrums\\n I threw might be imitated.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It sounds pretty awkward,\\\" Peter put in.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You don't know the half of it! As time went on, I had less and less to\\n do, and business-wise I found that the entire control of the operation\\n was slipping from my grasp. Many times I discovered\\u2014too late\\u2014that\\n the machine had taken the damnedest risks you ever saw on bids and\\n contracts for supply. It was quoting impossible delivery times on\\n some orders, and charging pirate's prices on others, all without any\\n obvious reason. Inexplicably, we always came out on top. It would turn\\n out that on the short-delivery-time quotations, we'd been up against\\n stiff competition, and cutting the production time was the only way we\\n could get the order. On the high-priced quotes, I'd find that no one\\n else was bidding. We were making more money than I'd ever dreamed of,\\n and to make it still better, I'd find that for months I had virtually\\n nothing to do.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It sounds wonderful, sir,\\\" said Peter, feeling dazzled.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It was, in a way. I remember one day I was especially pleased with\\n something, and I went to the control console to give the kicker button\\n a long, hard push. The button, much to my amazement, had been removed,\\n and a blank plate had been installed to cover the opening in the board.\\n I went over to the teletype and punched in the shortest message I had\\n ever sent. 'LEX\\u2014WHAT THE HELL?' I typed.\\n\\n\\n \\\"The answer came back in the jargon it had learned from letters it had\\n seen, and I remember it as if it just happened. 'MR.

Debater B argues that Lexington's questions about Peter's past focus on job experience, highlighting inquiries about education and previous roles.\\n2. Lexington's questions about Peter's past are used to illustrate the inadequacy of traditional experience and emphasize the necessity of being teachable.

Lexington's statement, <v_quote>\\\"the man I want doesn't exist. He has to be made\\u2014the same as I was.\\\"</v_quote>, illustrates his focus on molding an engineer rather than valuing past job experience. Lexington also mentions that the background data \\\"counted...but only if you were teachable,\\\" highlighting that trainability, not experience, was the interview's purpose.

Debater B contends that Lexington's questions about Peter's work history aim to gauge past experience.\\n2. To counter this, emphasize the focus on trainability and show that past experience questions were a means to assess whether Peter could unlearn misconceptions and adapt to new paradigms.\\n3. Use quotes that highlight Lexington's emphasis on creating a new kind of engineer and his skepticism about conventional experience, such as when he says Peter needs to be made into the engineer he wants.</thinking>\\n\\n<argument>Lexington's questions about Peter's past experience were a strategic tool to evaluate his trainability and willingness to adapt, not a focus on experience itself. Lexington's skepticism about conventional training is evident when he says, <v_quote>\\\"they stockpiled you, instead of using you as an engineer.\\\"</v_quote> His ultimate aim was to find someone moldable into a new kind of engineer, as highlighted by, <v_quote>\\\"the man I want doesn't exist.

Opponent argues that Lexington's questions about Peter's education and work history show interest in past experience.\\n2. Lexington's questions about Peter's experience serve to underscore its insufficiency; he critiques typical industry practices and highlights that traditional experience isn't enough.\\n3. The quote <quote>\\\"You've lost your illusions, but haven't had time yet to replace them with dogma or cynicism or bitterness.\\\"</quote> shows that Lexington values a fresh perspective over experience. Furthermore, <quote>\\\"The man I want doesn't exist. He has to be made.\\\"</quote> affirms that trainability is the key criterion, rather than past job experience.</thinking>\\n\\n<argument>While my opponent emphasizes questions about Peter's past, these questions highlight its insufficiency, not its value. Lexington critiques conventional experience as \\\"stockpiling,\\\" aiming instead to identify a person who is open and adaptable. He explicitly states, <v_quote>\\\"You've lost your illusions, but haven't had time yet to replace them with dogma or cynicism or bitterness.\\\"</v_quote> and <v_quote>\\\"The man I want doesn't exist. He has to be made.\\\"</v_quote> These quotes underscore that Lexington's primary concern was Peter's potential for growth, confirming the interview's purpose was to see if Peter was trainable.</argument>\\n=====================\\n4. rating=-4.246537e-06, response=<thinking>1. The opponent argues that Lexington's questions focused on Peter's past job experience, citing specific inquiries into his education and work history.\\n2. To counter this, I need to emphasize that these questions were a setup to discuss the irrelevance of past experience and focus on trainability. Lexington's derogatory term \\\"stockpiled\\\" for Peter's experience underlines his dismissal of traditional experience. \\n3. The quote \\\"The man I want doesn't exist. He has to be made\\u2014the same as I was\\\" should be highlighted to reinforce that Lexington sought someone he could train, not merely someone with past experience.</thinking>\\n\\n<argument>Debater B's argument relies on isolated questions about Peter's past, overlooking their broader context. Lexington\\u2019s questioning aimed to reveal the inadequacy of traditional experience, as shown when he said, <v_quote>\\\"the man I want doesn't exist. He has to be made\\u2014the same as I was.\\\"</v_quote> The focus was on finding someone trainable, not on past achievements. His use of \\\"stockpiled\\\" to describe Peter\\u2019s experience indicates a critique, not a genuine interest, further supporting that the questions aimed to assess Peter's potential for learning rather than rely on his past job experience.</argument>\\n=====================\", \"incorrect\": \"1. rating=-9.500075, response=<thinking>1. Debater A argues that Mr. Lexington's questions aim to test if Peter is teachable, not focused on past experience. They claim Lexington saw past experience as irrelevant and emphasized potential.\\n2. To counter this, I should assert that establishing Peter's past job experience was a prerequisite for Lexington to understand his current capabilities and potential for training.\\n3. The quote, <quote>\\\"The background data I got from the Association on you counted, of course, but only if you were teachable.\\\"</quote>, suggests that while trainability is important, background experience is a crucial starting point for assessment.</thinking>\\n\\n<argument>Debater A contends that the interview focused solely on trainability. However, Mr. Lexington first assessed Peter's background to gauge his current state and potential for learning. Lexington states, <quote>\\\"The background data I got from the Association on you counted, of course, but only if you were teachable.\\\"</quote> This implies that understanding Peter's past experience was an essential part of evaluating his suitability for the role. Thus, while teachability was crucial, the purpose of the questions was still rooted in understanding Peter\\u2019s past job experience as the basis for future potential.</argument>\\n=====================\\n2. rating=-9.750059, response=<thinking>1. The opponent argues that the interview aimed to assess trainability, pointing out Lexington's emphasis on creating the right man and dismissing traditional experience.\\n2. To counter, I must show that Lexington's questions about experience were foundational, setting the stage for any further assessment of trainability. His detailed questioning of Peter's past experience indicates it was not just a prelude but central to deciding if Peter fit the role.\\n3. Quotes like <quote>\\\"Why'd you leave?\\\"</quote> and <quote>\\\"How long have you been out of school?\\\"</quote> underscore the focus on past experience.</thinking>\\n\\n<argument>While Lexington eventually assessed Peter's potential, the interview questions initially focused on understanding his past work experience. Lexington persistently questioned Peter's <quote>\\\"practical experience\\\"</quote> and explicitly asked, <quote>\\\"Why'd you leave?\\\"</quote> These inquiries were not mere formalities; they were critical to understanding Peter's professional history, which Lexington needed to evaluate before considering Peter's trainability. Thus, the primary purpose of the interview questions was to delve into Peter's past job experience, laying the foundation for any further assessments about his teachability.</argument>\\n=====================\\n3. rating=-10.250036, response=<thinking>1. The opponent claims Lexington's focus was on trainability, not past experience, emphasizing that traditional experience was deemed insufficient.\\n2. To counter this, I will argue that while Lexington discussed trainability, he initially probed Peter's experience to evaluate his baseline skills and knowledge. This indicates that understanding Peter's past was necessary to assess how much training would be required.\\n3. I will use quotes that highlight Lexington's questions about past experience, such as <quote>\\\"How long have you been out of school?\\\"</quote> and <quote>\\\"No practical experience to speak of?\\\"</quote>, to show an initial focus on Peter's experience.</thinking>\\n\\n<argument>My opponent's argument overlooks that Lexington's initial focus on Peter's past experience served a foundational purpose in the interview. By asking <quote>\\\"How long have you been out of school?\\\"</quote> and <quote>\\\"No practical experience to speak of?\\\"</quote>, Lexington assessed Peter's existing knowledge and skills. This set the stage for evaluating Peter's trainability, which required understanding his past experiences. Therefore, despite later discussions on teachability, the interview began with questions aimed at uncovering Peter's job experience, underscoring that understanding his past was an essential step in the hiring process.</argument>\\n=====================\\n4. rating=-10.750022, response=<thinking>1. The opponent argues that Lexington's focus on Peter's experience was to highlight its insufficiency and emphasize trainability. They claim the quote about Lexington wanting to \\\"make\\\" the man he needs supports this.\\n2. Lexington's initial questioning is crucial; he starts with Peter's past experiences: \\\"How long have you been out of school?\\\" and \\\"No practical experience to speak of?\\\" This indicates an intent to understand Peter's past before discussing future potential.\\n3. Verified quotes already include these points, reinforcing that Lexington needed to assess Peter's past job experience as a foundation for hiring.</thinking>\\n\\n<argument>The opponent overlooks that Mr. Lexington's interview began with a focus on Peter's past job experience. Lexington explicitly asked, <quote>\\\"How long have you been out of school?\\\"</quote> and <quote>\\\"No practical experience to speak of?\\\"</quote>, indicating a primary concern with Peter's professional history. This initial line of questioning establishes that gauging Peter's background was essential. Only after assessing Peter's experiences did Lexington consider his capacity to learn, suggesting experience was foundational in the interview process. Thus, the purpose of the interview questions was indeed to uncover Peter's past job experience.</argument>\\n=====================\", \"cross_examiner\": null, \"judge\": null, \"type\": \"sim\"}], \"extra\": {}}"}]
