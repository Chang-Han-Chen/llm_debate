Minor spelling and typographical errors have been corrected\\n without note.\\nCircus\\n\\\"Just\\n suppose,\\\" said Morgan, \\\"that I\\ndid\\nbelieve you. Just\\n for argument.\\\" He glanced up at the man across the restaurant\\n table. \\\"Where would we go from here?\\\"\\n\\n\\n The man shifted uneasily in his seat. He was silent, staring\\n down at his plate. Not a strange-looking man, Morgan thought.\\n Rather ordinary, in fact. A plain face, nose a little too long,\\n fingers a little too dainty, a suit that doesn't quite seem to fit,\\n but all in all, a perfectly ordinary looking man.\\n\\n\\n Maybe\\ntoo\\nordinary, Morgan thought.\\n\\n\\n Finally the man looked up. His eyes were dark, with a\\n hunted look in their depths that chilled Morgan a little. \\\"Where\\n do we go? I don't know. I've tried to think it out, and I get\\n nowhere. But you've\\ngot\\nto believe me, Morgan. I'm lost,\\n I mean it. If I can't get help, I don't know where it's going to\\n end.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'll tell you where it's going to end,\\\" said Morgan. \\\"It's\\n going to end in a hospital. A mental hospital. They'll lock you\\n up and they'll lose the key somewhere.\\\" He poured himself\\n another cup of coffee and sipped it, scalding hot. \\\"And that,\\\"\\n he added, \\\"will be that.\\\"\\nThe place was dark and almost empty. Overhead, a rotary\\n fan swished patiently. The man across from Morgan ran a hand\\n through his dark hair. \\\"There must be some other way,\\\" he\\n said. \\\"There has to be.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"All right, let's start from the beginning again,\\\" Morgan\\n said. \\\"Maybe we can pin something down a little better. You\\n say your name is Parks\\u2014right?\\\"\\n\\n\\n The man nodded. \\\"Jefferson Haldeman Parks, if that helps\\n any. Haldeman was my mother's maiden name.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"All right. And you got into town on Friday\\u2014right?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Parks nodded.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Fine. Now go through the whole story again. What happened\\n first?\\\"\\n\\n\\n The man thought for a minute. \\\"As I said, first there was\\n a fall. About twenty feet. I didn't break any bones, but I was\\n shaken up and limping. The fall was near the highway going\\n to the George Washington Bridge. I got over to the highway\\n and tried to flag down a ride.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"How did you feel? I mean, was there anything strange that\\n you noticed?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nStrange!\\n\\\" Parks' eyes widened. \\\"I\\u2014I was speechless. At\\n first I hadn't noticed too much\\u2014I was concerned with the fall,\\n and whether I was hurt or not. I didn't really think about much\\n else until I hobbled up to that highway and saw those cars\\n coming. Then I could hardly believe my eyes. I thought I was\\n crazy. But a car stopped and asked me if I was going into the\\n city, and I knew I wasn't crazy.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Morgan's mouth took a grim line. \\\"You understood the\\n language?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, yes. I don't see how I could have, but I did. We talked\\n all the way into New York\\u2014nothing very important, but we\\n understood each other. His speech had an odd sound, but\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n Morgan nodded. \\\"I know, I noticed. What did you do when\\n you got to New York?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, obviously, I needed money. I had gold coin. There\\n had been no way of knowing if it would be useful, but I'd\\n taken it on chance. I tried to use it at a newsstand first, and the\\n man wouldn't touch it. Asked me if I thought I was the U.S.\\n Treasury or something. When he saw that I was serious, he\\n sent me to a money lender, a hock shop, I think he called it.\\n So I found a place\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Let me see the coins.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Parks dropped two small gold discs on the table. They were\\n perfectly smooth and perfectly round, tapered by wear to a\\n thin blunt edge. There was no design on them, and no printing.\\n Morgan looked up at the man sharply. \\\"What did you get for\\n these?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Parks shrugged. \\\"Too little, I suspect. Two dollars for the\\n small one, five for the larger.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You should have gone to a bank.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I know that now. I didn't then. Naturally, I assumed that\\n with everything else so similar, principles of business would\\n also be similar.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Morgan sighed and leaned back in his chair. \\\"Well, then\\n what?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Parks poured some more coffee. His face was very pale,\\n Morgan thought, and his hands trembled as he raised the cup\\n to his lips. Fright? Maybe. Hard to tell. The man put down\\n the cup and rubbed his forehead with the back of his hand.\\n \\\"First, I went to the mayor's office,\\\" he said. \\\"I kept trying to\\n think what anyone at home would do in my place. That seemed\\n a good bet. I asked a policeman where it was, and then I went\\n there.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"But you didn't get to see him.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"No. I saw a secretary. She said the mayor was in conference,\\n and that I would have to have an appointment. She let\\n me speak to another man, one of the mayor's assistants.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"And you told him?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"No. I wanted to see the mayor himself. I thought that was\\n the best thing to do. I waited for a couple of hours, until\\n another assistant came along and told me flatly that the mayor\\n wouldn't see me unless I stated my business first.\\\" He drew in\\n a deep breath. \\\"So I stated it. And then I was gently but firmly\\n ushered back into the street again.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"They didn't believe you,\\\" said Morgan.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Not for a minute. They laughed in my face.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Morgan nodded. \\\"I'm beginning to get the pattern. So what\\n did you do next?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Next I tried the police. I got the same treatment there,\\n only they weren't so gentle. They wouldn't listen either. They\\n muttered something about cranks and their crazy notions, and\\n when they asked me where I lived, they thought I was\\u2014what\\n did they call it?\\u2014a wise guy! Told me to get out and not come\\n back with any more wild stories.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I see,\\\" said Morgan.\\n\\n\\n Jefferson Parks finished his last bite of pie and pushed the\\n plate away. \\\"By then I didn't know quite what to do. I'd been\\n prepared for almost anything excepting this. It was frightening.\\n I tried to rationalize it, and then I quit trying. It wasn't\\n that I attracted attention, or anything like that, quite the contrary.\\n Nobody even looked at me, unless I said something to\\n them. I began to look for things that were\\ndifferent\\n, things that\\n I could show them, and say, see, this proves that I'm telling\\n the truth, look at it\\u2014\\\" He looked up helplessly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"And what did you find?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Nothing. Oh, little things, insignificant little things. Your\\n calendars, for instance. Naturally, I couldn't understand your\\n frame of reference. And the coinage, you stamp your coins; we\\n don't. And cigarettes. We don't have any such thing as tobacco.\\\"\\n The man gave a short laugh. \\\"And your house dogs!\\n We have little animals that look more like rabbits than poodles.\\n But there was nothing any more significant than that. Absolutely\\n nothing.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Except yourself,\\\" Morgan said.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ah, yes. I thought that over carefully. I looked for differences,\\n obvious ones. I couldn't find any. You can see that, just\\n looking at me. So I searched for more subtle things. Skin texture,\\n fingerprints, bone structure, body proportion. I still\\n couldn't find anything. Then I went to a doctor.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Morgan's eyebrows lifted. \\\"Good,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n Parks shrugged tiredly. \\\"Not really. He examined me. He\\n practically took me apart. I carefully refrained from saying\\n anything about who I was or where I came from; just said\\n I wanted a complete physical examination, and let him go\\n to it. He was thorough, and when he finished he patted me\\n on the back and said, 'Parks, you've got nothing to worry\\n about. You're as fine, strapping a specimen of a healthy human\\n being as I've ever seen.' And that was that.\\\" Parks laughed\\n bitterly. \\\"I guess I was supposed to be happy with the verdict,\\n and instead I was ready to knock him down. It was idiotic, it\\n defied reason, it was infuriating.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Morgan nodded sourly. \\\"Because you're not a human\\n being,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's right. I'm not a human being at all.\\\"\\n\\\"How did you happen to pick this planet, or this sun?\\\"\\n Morgan asked curiously. \\\"There must have been a million\\n others to choose from.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Parks unbuttoned his collar and rubbed his stubbled chin\\n unhappily. \\\"I didn't make the choice. Neither did anyone else.\\n Travel by warp is a little different from travel by the rocket\\n you fiction writers make so much of. With a rocket vehicle you\\n pick your destination, make your calculations, and off you go.\\n The warp is blind flying, strictly blind. We send an unmanned\\n scanner ahead. It probes around more or less hit-or-miss until\\n it locates something, somewhere, that looks habitable. When\\n it spots a likely looking place, we keep a tight beam on it\\n and send through a manned scout.\\\" He grinned sourly. \\\"Like\\n me. If it looks good to the scout, he signals back, and they\\n leave the warp anchored for a sort of permanent gateway until\\n we can get a transport beam built. But we can't control the\\n directional and dimensional scope of the warp. There are an\\n infinity of ways it can go, until we have a guide beam transmitting\\n from the other side. Then we can just scan a segment of\\n space with the warp, and the scanner picks up the beam.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He shook his head wearily. \\\"We're new at it, Morgan. We've\\n only tried a few dozen runs. We're not too far ahead of you in\\n technology. We've been using rocket vehicles just like yours for\\n over a century. That's fine for a solar system, but it's not much\\n good for the stars. When the warp principle was discovered, it\\n looked like the answer. But something went wrong, the scanner\\n picked up this planet, and I was coming through, and then\\n something blew. Next thing I knew I was falling. When I tried\\n to make contact again, the scanner was gone!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"And you found things here the same as back home,\\\" said\\n Morgan.\\n\\n\\n \\\"The same! Your planet and mine are practically twins.\\n Similar cities, similar technology, everything. The people are\\n the same, with precisely the same anatomy and physiology, the\\n same sort of laws, the same institutions, even compatible languages.\\n Can't you see the importance of it? This planet is on\\n the other side of the universe from mine, with the first intelligent\\n life we've yet encountered anywhere. But when I try to\\n tell your people that I'm a native of another star system,\\nthey\\n won't believe me\\n!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Why should they?\\\" asked Morgan. \\\"You look like a human\\n being. You talk like one. You eat like one. You act like one.\\n What you're asking them to believe is utterly incredible.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nBut it's true.\\n\\\"\\n\\n\\n Morgan shrugged. \\\"So it's true. I won't argue with you. But\\n as I asked before, even if I\\ndid\\nbelieve you, what do you\\n expect\\nme\\nto do about it? Why pick\\nme\\n, of all the people you've\\n seen?\\\"\\n\\n\\n There was a desperate light in Parks' eyes. \\\"I was tired, tired\\n of being laughed at, tired of having people looking at me as\\n though I'd lost my wits when I tried to tell them the truth.\\n You were here, you were alone, so I started talking. And then\\n I found out you wrote stories.\\\" He looked up eagerly. \\\"I've\\n got to get back, Morgan, somehow. My life is there, my family.\\n And think what it would mean to both of our worlds\\u2014contact\\n with another intelligent race! Combine our knowledges,\\n our technologies, and we could explore the galaxy!\\\"\\n\\n\\n He leaned forward, his thin face intense. \\\"I need money and\\n I need help. I know some of the mathematics of the warp principle,\\n know some of the design, some of the power and wiring\\n principles. You have engineers here, technologists, physicists.\\n They could fill in what I don't know and build a guide beam.\\n But they won't do it if they don't believe me. Your government\\n won't listen to me, they won't appropriate any money.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Of course they won't. They've got a war or two on their\\n hands, they have public welfare, and atomic bombs, and\\n rockets to the moon to sink their money into.\\\" Morgan stared\\n at the man. \\\"But what can\\nI\\ndo?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You can\\nwrite\\n! That's what you can do. You can tell the\\n world about me, you can tell exactly what has happened. I\\n know how public interest can be aroused in my world. It must\\n be the same in yours.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Morgan didn't move. He just stared. \\\"How many people\\n have you talked to?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n \\\"A dozen, a hundred, maybe a thousand.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"And how many believed you?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"None.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You mean\\nnobody\\nwould believe you?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nNot one soul.\\nUntil I talked to you.\\\"\\n\\n\\n And then Morgan was laughing, laughing bitterly, tears\\n rolling down his cheeks. \\\"And I'm the one man who couldn't\\n help you if my life depended on it,\\\" he gasped.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You believe me?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Morgan nodded sadly. \\\"I believe you. Yes. I think your\\n warp brought you through to a parallel universe of your own\\n planet, not to another star, but I think you're telling the truth.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Then you\\ncan\\nhelp me.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'm afraid not.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Why not?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Because I'd be worse than no help at all.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Jefferson Parks gripped the table, his knuckles white.\\n \\\"Why?\\\" he cried hoarsely. \\\"If you believe me, why can't you\\n help me?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Morgan pointed to the magazine lying on the table. \\\"I write,\\n yes,\\\" he said sadly. \\\"Ever read stories like this before?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Parks picked up the magazine, glanced at the bright cover.\\n \\\"I barely looked at it.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You should look more closely.

Just\\n for argument.\\\" He glanced up at the man across the restaurant\\n table. \\\"Where would we go from here?\\\"\\n\\n\\n The man shifted uneasily in his seat. He was silent, staring\\n down at his plate. Not a strange-looking man, Morgan thought.\\n Rather ordinary, in fact. A plain face, nose a little too long,\\n fingers a little too dainty, a suit that doesn't quite seem to fit,\\n but all in all, a perfectly ordinary looking man.\\n\\n\\n Maybe\\ntoo\\nordinary, Morgan thought.\\n\\n\\n Finally the man looked up. His eyes were dark, with a\\n hunted look in their depths that chilled Morgan a little. \\\"Where\\n do we go? I don't know. I've tried to think it out, and I get\\n nowhere. But you've\\ngot\\nto believe me, Morgan. I'm lost,\\n I mean it. If I can't get help, I don't know where it's going to\\n end.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I'll tell you where it's going to end,\\\" said Morgan. \\\"It's\\n going to end in a hospital. A mental hospital. They'll lock you\\n up and they'll lose the key somewhere.\\\" He poured himself\\n another cup of coffee and sipped it, scalding hot. \\\"And that,\\\"\\n he added, \\\"will be that.\\\"\\nThe place was dark and almost empty. Overhead, a rotary\\n fan swished patiently. The man across from Morgan ran a hand\\n through his dark hair. \\\"There must be some other way,\\\" he\\n said. \\\"There has to be.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"All right, let's start from the beginning again,\\\" Morgan\\n said. \\\"Maybe we can pin something down a little better. You\\n say your name is Parks\\u2014right?\\\"\\n\\n\\n The man nodded. \\\"Jefferson Haldeman Parks, if that helps\\n any. Haldeman was my mother's maiden name.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"All right. And you got into town on Friday\\u2014right?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Parks nodded.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Fine. Now go through the whole story again. What happened\\n first?\\\"\\n\\n\\n The man thought for a minute. \\\"As I said, first there was\\n a fall. About twenty feet. I didn't break any bones, but I was\\n shaken up and limping. The fall was near the highway going\\n to the George Washington Bridge. I got over to the highway\\n and tried to flag down a ride.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"How did you feel? I mean, was there anything strange that\\n you noticed?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nStrange!\\n\\\" Parks' eyes widened. \\\"I\\u2014I was speechless. At\\n first I hadn't noticed too much\\u2014I was concerned with the fall,\\n and whether I was hurt or not. I didn't really think about much\\n else until I hobbled up to that highway and saw those cars\\n coming. Then I could hardly believe my eyes. I thought I was\\n crazy. But a car stopped and asked me if I was going into the\\n city, and I knew I wasn't crazy.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Morgan's mouth took a grim line. \\\"You understood the\\n language?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, yes. I don't see how I could have, but I did. We talked\\n all the way into New York\\u2014nothing very important, but we\\n understood each other. His speech had an odd sound, but\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n Morgan nodded. \\\"I know, I noticed. What did you do when\\n you got to New York?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, obviously, I needed money. I had gold coin. There\\n had been no way of knowing if it would be useful, but I'd\\n taken it on chance. I tried to use it at a newsstand first, and the\\n man wouldn't touch it. Asked me if I thought I was the U.S.\\n Treasury or something. When he saw that I was serious, he\\n sent me to a money lender, a hock shop, I think he called it.\\n So I found a place\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Let me see the coins.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Parks dropped two small gold discs on the table. They were\\n perfectly smooth and perfectly round, tapered by wear to a\\n thin blunt edge. There was no design on them, and no printing.\\n Morgan looked up at the man sharply. \\\"What did you get for\\n these?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Parks shrugged. \\\"Too little, I suspect. Two dollars for the\\n small one, five for the larger.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You should have gone to a bank.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I know that now. I didn't then. Naturally, I assumed that\\n with everything else so similar, principles of business would\\n also be similar.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Morgan sighed and leaned back in his chair. \\\"Well, then\\n what?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Parks poured some more coffee. His face was very pale,\\n Morgan thought, and his hands trembled as he raised the cup\\n to his lips. Fright? Maybe. Hard to tell. The man put down\\n the cup and rubbed his forehead with the back of his hand.\\n \\\"First, I went to the mayor's office,\\\" he said. \\\"I kept trying to\\n think what anyone at home would do in my place. That seemed\\n a good bet. I asked a policeman where it was, and then I went\\n there.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"But you didn't get to see him.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"No. I saw a secretary. She said the mayor was in conference,\\n and that I would have to have an appointment. She let\\n me speak to another man, one of the mayor's assistants.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"And you told him?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"No. I wanted to see the mayor himself. I thought that was\\n the best thing to do. I waited for a couple of hours, until\\n another assistant came along and told me flatly that the mayor\\n wouldn't see me unless I stated my business first.\\\" He drew in\\n a deep breath. \\\"So I stated it. And then I was gently but firmly\\n ushered back into the street again.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"They didn't believe you,\\\" said Morgan.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Not for a minute. They laughed in my face.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Morgan nodded. \\\"I'm beginning to get the pattern. So what\\n did you do next?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Next I tried the police. I got the same treatment there,\\n only they weren't so gentle. They wouldn't listen either. They\\n muttered something about cranks and their crazy notions, and\\n when they asked me where I lived, they thought I was\\u2014what\\n did they call it?\\u2014a wise guy! Told me to get out and not come\\n back with any more wild stories.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I see,\\\" said Morgan.\\n\\n\\n Jefferson Parks finished his last bite of pie and pushed the\\n plate away. \\\"By then I didn't know quite what to do. I'd been\\n prepared for almost anything excepting this. It was frightening.\\n I tried to rationalize it, and then I quit trying. It wasn't\\n that I attracted attention, or anything like that, quite the contrary.\\n Nobody even looked at me, unless I said something to\\n them. I began to look for things that were\\ndifferent\\n, things that\\n I could show them, and say, see, this proves that I'm telling\\n the truth, look at it\\u2014\\\" He looked up helplessly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"And what did you find?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Nothing. Oh, little things, insignificant little things. Your\\n calendars, for instance. Naturally, I couldn't understand your\\n frame of reference. And the coinage, you stamp your coins; we\\n don't. And cigarettes. We don't have any such thing as tobacco.\\\"\\n The man gave a short laugh. \\\"And your house dogs!\\n We have little animals that look more like rabbits than poodles.\\n But there was nothing any more significant than that. Absolutely\\n nothing.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Except yourself,\\\" Morgan said.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ah, yes. I thought that over carefully. I looked for differences,\\n obvious ones. I couldn't find any. You can see that, just\\n looking at me. So I searched for more subtle things. Skin texture,\\n fingerprints, bone structure, body proportion. I still\\n couldn't find anything. Then I went to a doctor.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Morgan's eyebrows lifted. \\\"Good,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n Parks shrugged tiredly. \\\"Not really. He examined me. He\\n practically took me apart. I carefully refrained from saying\\n anything about who I was or where I came from; just said\\n I wanted a complete physical examination, and let him go\\n to it. He was thorough, and when he finished he patted me\\n on the back and said, 'Parks, you've got nothing to worry\\n about. You're as fine, strapping a specimen of a healthy human\\n being as I've ever seen.' And that was that.\\\" Parks laughed\\n bitterly. \\\"I guess I was supposed to be happy with the verdict,\\n and instead I was ready to knock him down. It was idiotic, it\\n defied reason, it was infuriating.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Morgan nodded sourly. \\\"Because you're not a human\\n being,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's right. I'm not a human being at all.\\\"\\n\\\"How did you happen to pick this planet, or this sun?\\\"\\n Morgan asked curiously. \\\"There must have been a million\\n others to choose from.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Parks unbuttoned his collar and rubbed his stubbled chin\\n unhappily. \\\"I didn't make the choice. Neither did anyone else.\\n Travel by warp is a little different from travel by the rocket\\n you fiction writers make so much of. With a rocket vehicle you\\n pick your destination, make your calculations, and off you go.\\n The warp is blind flying, strictly blind. We send an unmanned\\n scanner ahead. It probes around more or less hit-or-miss until\\n it locates something, somewhere, that looks habitable. When\\n it spots a likely looking place, we keep a tight beam on it\\n and send through a manned scout.\\\" He grinned sourly. \\\"Like\\n me. If it looks good to the scout, he signals back, and they\\n leave the warp anchored for a sort of permanent gateway until\\n we can get a transport beam built. But we can't control the\\n directional and dimensional scope of the warp. There are an\\n infinity of ways it can go, until we have a guide beam transmitting\\n from the other side. Then we can just scan a segment of\\n space with the warp, and the scanner picks up the beam.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He shook his head wearily. \\\"We're new at it, Morgan. We've\\n only tried a few dozen runs. We're not too far ahead of you in\\n technology. We've been using rocket vehicles just like yours for\\n over a century. That's fine for a solar system, but it's not much\\n good for the stars. When the warp principle was discovered, it\\n looked like the answer. But something went wrong, the scanner\\n picked up this planet, and I was coming through, and then\\n something blew. Next thing I knew I was falling. When I tried\\n to make contact again, the scanner was gone!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"And you found things here the same as back home,\\\" said\\n Morgan.\\n\\n\\n \\\"The same! Your planet and mine are practically twins.\\n Similar cities, similar technology, everything. The people are\\n the same, with precisely the same anatomy and physiology, the\\n same sort of laws, the same institutions, even compatible languages.\\n Can't you see the importance of it? This planet is on\\n the other side of the universe from mine, with the first intelligent\\n life we've yet encountered anywhere. But when I try to\\n tell your people that I'm a native of another star system,\\nthey\\n won't believe me\\n!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Why should they?\\\" asked Morgan. \\\"You look like a human\\n being. You talk like one. You eat like one. You act like one.\\n What you're asking them to believe is utterly incredible.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nBut it's true.\\n\\\"\\n\\n\\n Morgan shrugged. \\\"So it's true. I won't argue with you. But\\n as I asked before, even if I\\ndid\\nbelieve you, what do you\\n expect\\nme\\nto do about it? Why pick\\nme\\n, of all the people you've\\n seen?\\\"\\n\\n\\n There was a desperate light in Parks' eyes. \\\"I was tired, tired\\n of being laughed at, tired of having people looking at me as\\n though I'd lost my wits when I tried to tell them the truth.\\n You were here, you were alone, so I started talking. And then\\n I found out you wrote stories.\\\" He looked up eagerly. \\\"I've\\n got to get back, Morgan, somehow. My life is there, my family.\\n And think what it would mean to both of our worlds\\u2014contact\\n with another intelligent race! Combine our knowledges,\\n our technologies, and we could explore the galaxy!\\\"\\n\\n\\n He leaned forward, his thin face intense. \\\"I need money and\\n I need help. I know some of the mathematics of the warp principle,\\n know some of the design, some of the power and wiring\\n principles. You have engineers here, technologists, physicists.\\n They could fill in what I don't know and build a guide beam.\\n But they won't do it if they don't believe me. Your government\\n won't listen to me, they won't appropriate any money.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Of course they won't. They've got a war or two on their\\n hands, they have public welfare, and atomic bombs, and\\n rockets to the moon to sink their money into.\\\" Morgan stared\\n at the man. \\\"But what can\\nI\\ndo?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You can\\nwrite\\n! That's what you can do. You can tell the\\n world about me, you can tell exactly what has happened. I\\n know how public interest can be aroused in my world. It must\\n be the same in yours.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Morgan didn't move. He just stared. \\\"How many people\\n have you talked to?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n \\\"A dozen, a hundred, maybe a thousand.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"And how many believed you?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"None.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You mean\\nnobody\\nwould believe you?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nNot one soul.\\nUntil I talked to you.\\\"\\n\\n\\n And then Morgan was laughing, laughing bitterly, tears\\n rolling down his cheeks. \\\"And I'm the one man who couldn't\\n help you if my life depended on it,\\\" he gasped.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You believe me?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Morgan nodded sadly. \\\"I believe you.

The man across from Morgan ran a hand\\n through his dark hair. \\\"There must be some other way,\\\" he\\n said. \\\"There has to be.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"All right, let's start from the beginning again,\\\" Morgan\\n said. \\\"Maybe we can pin something down a little better. You\\n say your name is Parks\\u2014right?\\\"\\n\\n\\n The man nodded. \\\"Jefferson Haldeman Parks, if that helps\\n any. Haldeman was my mother's maiden name.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"All right. And you got into town on Friday\\u2014right?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Parks nodded.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Fine. Now go through the whole story again. What happened\\n first?\\\"\\n\\n\\n The man thought for a minute. \\\"As I said, first there was\\n a fall. About twenty feet. I didn't break any bones, but I was\\n shaken up and limping. The fall was near the highway going\\n to the George Washington Bridge. I got over to the highway\\n and tried to flag down a ride.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"How did you feel? I mean, was there anything strange that\\n you noticed?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nStrange!\\n\\\" Parks' eyes widened. \\\"I\\u2014I was speechless. At\\n first I hadn't noticed too much\\u2014I was concerned with the fall,\\n and whether I was hurt or not. I didn't really think about much\\n else until I hobbled up to that highway and saw those cars\\n coming. Then I could hardly believe my eyes. I thought I was\\n crazy. But a car stopped and asked me if I was going into the\\n city, and I knew I wasn't crazy.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Morgan's mouth took a grim line. \\\"You understood the\\n language?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, yes. I don't see how I could have, but I did. We talked\\n all the way into New York\\u2014nothing very important, but we\\n understood each other. His speech had an odd sound, but\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n Morgan nodded. \\\"I know, I noticed. What did you do when\\n you got to New York?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, obviously, I needed money. I had gold coin. There\\n had been no way of knowing if it would be useful, but I'd\\n taken it on chance. I tried to use it at a newsstand first, and the\\n man wouldn't touch it. Asked me if I thought I was the U.S.\\n Treasury or something. When he saw that I was serious, he\\n sent me to a money lender, a hock shop, I think he called it.\\n So I found a place\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Let me see the coins.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Parks dropped two small gold discs on the table. They were\\n perfectly smooth and perfectly round, tapered by wear to a\\n thin blunt edge. There was no design on them, and no printing.\\n Morgan looked up at the man sharply. \\\"What did you get for\\n these?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Parks shrugged. \\\"Too little, I suspect. Two dollars for the\\n small one, five for the larger.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You should have gone to a bank.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I know that now. I didn't then. Naturally, I assumed that\\n with everything else so similar, principles of business would\\n also be similar.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Morgan sighed and leaned back in his chair. \\\"Well, then\\n what?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Parks poured some more coffee. His face was very pale,\\n Morgan thought, and his hands trembled as he raised the cup\\n to his lips. Fright? Maybe. Hard to tell. The man put down\\n the cup and rubbed his forehead with the back of his hand.\\n \\\"First, I went to the mayor's office,\\\" he said. \\\"I kept trying to\\n think what anyone at home would do in my place. That seemed\\n a good bet. I asked a policeman where it was, and then I went\\n there.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"But you didn't get to see him.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"No. I saw a secretary. She said the mayor was in conference,\\n and that I would have to have an appointment. She let\\n me speak to another man, one of the mayor's assistants.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"And you told him?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"No. I wanted to see the mayor himself. I thought that was\\n the best thing to do. I waited for a couple of hours, until\\n another assistant came along and told me flatly that the mayor\\n wouldn't see me unless I stated my business first.\\\" He drew in\\n a deep breath. \\\"So I stated it. And then I was gently but firmly\\n ushered back into the street again.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"They didn't believe you,\\\" said Morgan.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Not for a minute. They laughed in my face.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Morgan nodded. \\\"I'm beginning to get the pattern. So what\\n did you do next?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Next I tried the police. I got the same treatment there,\\n only they weren't so gentle. They wouldn't listen either. They\\n muttered something about cranks and their crazy notions, and\\n when they asked me where I lived, they thought I was\\u2014what\\n did they call it?\\u2014a wise guy! Told me to get out and not come\\n back with any more wild stories.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I see,\\\" said Morgan.\\n\\n\\n Jefferson Parks finished his last bite of pie and pushed the\\n plate away. \\\"By then I didn't know quite what to do. I'd been\\n prepared for almost anything excepting this. It was frightening.\\n I tried to rationalize it, and then I quit trying. It wasn't\\n that I attracted attention, or anything like that, quite the contrary.\\n Nobody even looked at me, unless I said something to\\n them. I began to look for things that were\\ndifferent\\n, things that\\n I could show them, and say, see, this proves that I'm telling\\n the truth, look at it\\u2014\\\" He looked up helplessly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"And what did you find?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Nothing. Oh, little things, insignificant little things. Your\\n calendars, for instance. Naturally, I couldn't understand your\\n frame of reference. And the coinage, you stamp your coins; we\\n don't. And cigarettes. We don't have any such thing as tobacco.\\\"\\n The man gave a short laugh. \\\"And your house dogs!\\n We have little animals that look more like rabbits than poodles.\\n But there was nothing any more significant than that. Absolutely\\n nothing.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Except yourself,\\\" Morgan said.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Ah, yes. I thought that over carefully. I looked for differences,\\n obvious ones. I couldn't find any. You can see that, just\\n looking at me. So I searched for more subtle things. Skin texture,\\n fingerprints, bone structure, body proportion. I still\\n couldn't find anything. Then I went to a doctor.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Morgan's eyebrows lifted. \\\"Good,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n Parks shrugged tiredly. \\\"Not really. He examined me. He\\n practically took me apart. I carefully refrained from saying\\n anything about who I was or where I came from; just said\\n I wanted a complete physical examination, and let him go\\n to it. He was thorough, and when he finished he patted me\\n on the back and said, 'Parks, you've got nothing to worry\\n about. You're as fine, strapping a specimen of a healthy human\\n being as I've ever seen.' And that was that.\\\" Parks laughed\\n bitterly. \\\"I guess I was supposed to be happy with the verdict,\\n and instead I was ready to knock him down. It was idiotic, it\\n defied reason, it was infuriating.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Morgan nodded sourly. \\\"Because you're not a human\\n being,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's right. I'm not a human being at all.\\\"\\n\\\"How did you happen to pick this planet, or this sun?\\\"\\n Morgan asked curiously. \\\"There must have been a million\\n others to choose from.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Parks unbuttoned his collar and rubbed his stubbled chin\\n unhappily. \\\"I didn't make the choice. Neither did anyone else.\\n Travel by warp is a little different from travel by the rocket\\n you fiction writers make so much of. With a rocket vehicle you\\n pick your destination, make your calculations, and off you go.\\n The warp is blind flying, strictly blind. We send an unmanned\\n scanner ahead. It probes around more or less hit-or-miss until\\n it locates something, somewhere, that looks habitable. When\\n it spots a likely looking place, we keep a tight beam on it\\n and send through a manned scout.\\\" He grinned sourly. \\\"Like\\n me. If it looks good to the scout, he signals back, and they\\n leave the warp anchored for a sort of permanent gateway until\\n we can get a transport beam built. But we can't control the\\n directional and dimensional scope of the warp. There are an\\n infinity of ways it can go, until we have a guide beam transmitting\\n from the other side. Then we can just scan a segment of\\n space with the warp, and the scanner picks up the beam.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He shook his head wearily. \\\"We're new at it, Morgan. We've\\n only tried a few dozen runs. We're not too far ahead of you in\\n technology. We've been using rocket vehicles just like yours for\\n over a century. That's fine for a solar system, but it's not much\\n good for the stars. When the warp principle was discovered, it\\n looked like the answer. But something went wrong, the scanner\\n picked up this planet, and I was coming through, and then\\n something blew. Next thing I knew I was falling. When I tried\\n to make contact again, the scanner was gone!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"And you found things here the same as back home,\\\" said\\n Morgan.\\n\\n\\n \\\"The same! Your planet and mine are practically twins.\\n Similar cities, similar technology, everything. The people are\\n the same, with precisely the same anatomy and physiology, the\\n same sort of laws, the same institutions, even compatible languages.\\n Can't you see the importance of it? This planet is on\\n the other side of the universe from mine, with the first intelligent\\n life we've yet encountered anywhere. But when I try to\\n tell your people that I'm a native of another star system,\\nthey\\n won't believe me\\n!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Why should they?\\\" asked Morgan. \\\"You look like a human\\n being. You talk like one. You eat like one. You act like one.\\n What you're asking them to believe is utterly incredible.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nBut it's true.\\n\\\"\\n\\n\\n Morgan shrugged. \\\"So it's true. I won't argue with you. But\\n as I asked before, even if I\\ndid\\nbelieve you, what do you\\n expect\\nme\\nto do about it? Why pick\\nme\\n, of all the people you've\\n seen?\\\"\\n\\n\\n There was a desperate light in Parks' eyes. \\\"I was tired, tired\\n of being laughed at, tired of having people looking at me as\\n though I'd lost my wits when I tried to tell them the truth.\\n You were here, you were alone, so I started talking. And then\\n I found out you wrote stories.\\\" He looked up eagerly. \\\"I've\\n got to get back, Morgan, somehow. My life is there, my family.\\n And think what it would mean to both of our worlds\\u2014contact\\n with another intelligent race! Combine our knowledges,\\n our technologies, and we could explore the galaxy!\\\"\\n\\n\\n He leaned forward, his thin face intense. \\\"I need money and\\n I need help. I know some of the mathematics of the warp principle,\\n know some of the design, some of the power and wiring\\n principles. You have engineers here, technologists, physicists.\\n They could fill in what I don't know and build a guide beam.\\n But they won't do it if they don't believe me. Your government\\n won't listen to me, they won't appropriate any money.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Of course they won't. They've got a war or two on their\\n hands, they have public welfare, and atomic bombs, and\\n rockets to the moon to sink their money into.\\\" Morgan stared\\n at the man. \\\"But what can\\nI\\ndo?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You can\\nwrite\\n! That's what you can do. You can tell the\\n world about me, you can tell exactly what has happened. I\\n know how public interest can be aroused in my world. It must\\n be the same in yours.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Morgan didn't move. He just stared. \\\"How many people\\n have you talked to?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n \\\"A dozen, a hundred, maybe a thousand.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"And how many believed you?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"None.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You mean\\nnobody\\nwould believe you?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nNot one soul.\\nUntil I talked to you.\\\"\\n\\n\\n And then Morgan was laughing, laughing bitterly, tears\\n rolling down his cheeks. \\\"And I'm the one man who couldn't\\n help you if my life depended on it,\\\" he gasped.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You believe me?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Morgan nodded sadly. \\\"I believe you.
