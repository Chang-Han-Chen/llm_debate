This was the administrative heart of Venus City. Out here,\\n alone, he let his only known emotion sweep through him, pride. He had\\n an important role in the building of this great new city. As head of\\n the Venus Consolidated Research Organization, he was in large part\\n responsible for the prosperity of this vigorous, young world. Venus\\n Consolidated had built up this city and practically everything else\\n that amounted to anything on this planet. True, there had been others,\\n pioneers, before the company came, who objected to the expansion of the\\n monopolistic control. But, if they could not realize that the company's\\n regime served the best interests of the planet, they would just have to\\n suffer the consequences of their own ignorance. There had been rumors\\n of revolution among the disgruntled older families.\\n\\n\\n He heard there had been killings, but that was nonsense. Venus\\n Consolidated police had only powers of arrest. Anything involving\\n executions had to be referred to the Interplanetary Council on Earth.\\n He dismissed the whole business as he did everything else that did not\\n directly influence his own department.\\n\\n\\n He ignored the surface transport system and walked to his own\\n apartment. This walk was part of a regular routine of physical exercise\\n that kept his body hard and resilient in spite of long hours spent in\\n the laboratory. As he opened the door of his apartment he heard the\\n water running into his bath. Perfect timing. He was making that walk\\n in precisely seven minutes, four and four-fifths seconds. He undressed\\n and climbed into the tub, relaxing luxuriously in the exhilaration of\\n irradiated water.\\n\\n\\n He let all the problems of his work drift away, his mind was a peaceful\\n blank. Then someone was hammering on his head. He struggled reluctantly\\n awake. It was the door that was being attacked, not his head. The\\n battering thunder continued persistently. He swore and sat up.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What do you want?\\\"\\n\\n\\n There was no answer; the hammering continued.\\n\\n\\n \\\"All right! All right! I'm coming!\\\" He yelled, crawled out of the tub\\n and reached for his bathrobe. It wasn't there. He swore some more and\\n grabbed a towel, wrapping it inadequately around him; it didn't quite\\n meet astern. He paddled wetly across the floor sounding like a flock of\\n ducks on parade.\\n\\n\\n Retaining the towel with one hand he inched the door cautiously open.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What the devil\\u2014\\\" He stopped abruptly at the sight of a policeman's\\n uniform.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Sorry, sir, but one of those rebels is loose in the Administration\\n Center somewhere. We're making a check-up of all the apartments.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, you can check out; I haven't got any blasted rebels in here.\\\"\\n The policeman's face hardened, then relaxed knowingly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, I see, sir. No rebels, of course. Sorry to have disturbed you.\\n Have a good\\u2014Good night, sir,\\\" he saluted and left.\\n\\n\\n Brian closed the door in puzzlement. What the devil had that flat-foot\\n been smirking about? Well, maybe he could get his bath now.\\nHanson turned away from the door and froze in amazement. Through the\\n open door of his bedroom he could see his bed neatly turned down as\\n it should be, but the outline under the counterpane and the luxuriant\\n mass of platinum-blond hair on the pillow was certainly no part of his\\n regular routine.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Hello.\\\" The voice matched the calm alertness of a pair of deep-blue\\n eyes. Brian just stared at her in numbed fascination. That was what the\\n policeman had meant with his insinuating smirk.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Just ask for Myrtle.\\\" Pete Brent's joking words flashed back to him.\\n Now he got it. This was probably the young fool's idea of a joke. He'd\\n soon fix that.\\n\\n\\n \\\"All right, joke's over, you can beat it now.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Joke? I don't see anything funny, unless it's you and that suggestive\\n towel. You should either abandon it or get one that goes all the way\\n round.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Brian slowly acquired a complexion suitable for painting fire plugs.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Shut up and throw me my dressing gown.\\\" He gritted.\\n\\n\\n The girl swung her legs out of bed and Brian blinked; she was fully\\n dressed. The snug, zippered overall suit she wore did nothing to\\n conceal the fact that she was a female. He wrapped his bathrobe\\n austerely around him.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, now what?\\\" she asked and looked at him questioningly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, what do you think?\\\" he burst out angrily. \\\"I'm going to finish\\n my bath and I'd suggest you go down to the laboratory and hold hands\\n with Pete. He'd appreciate it.\\\" He got the impression that the girl was\\n struggling heroically to refrain from laughing and that didn't help his\\n dignity any. He strode into the bathroom, slammed the door and climbed\\n back into the bath.\\n\\n\\n The door opened a little.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, good-by now.\\\" The girl said sweetly. \\\"Remember me to the police\\n force.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Get out of here!\\\" he yelled and the door shut abruptly on a rippling\\n burst of laughter. Damn women! It was getting so a man had to pack\\n a gun with him or something. And Pete Brent. He thought with grim\\n satisfaction of the unending extra work that was going to occur around\\n the laboratory from now on. He sank back into the soothing liquid\\n embrace of the bath and deliberately set his mind loose to wander in\\n complete relaxation.\\n\\n\\n A hammering thunder burst on the outer door. He sat up with a groan.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Lay off, you crazy apes!\\\" he yelled furiously, but the pounding\\n continued steadily. He struggled out of the bath, wrapped his damp\\n bathrobe clammily around him and marched to the door with a seething\\n fury of righteous anger burning within him. He flung the door wide, his\\n mouth all set for a withering barrage, but he didn't get a chance. Four\\n police constables and a sergeant swarmed into the room, shoving him\\n away from the door.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Say! What the\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Where is she?\\\" the sergeant demanded.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Wherethehell's who?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Quit stallin', bud. You know who. That female rebel who was in here.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Rebel? You're crazy! That was just ... Pete said ... rebel? Did you\\n say rebel?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yeah, I said rebel, an' where is she?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"She ... why ... why ... she left, of course. You don't think I was\\n going to have women running around in here, do you?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"She wuz in his bed when I seen her, sarge,\\\" one of the guards\\n contributed. \\\"But she ain't there now.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You don't think that I\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Listen, bud, we don't do the thinkin' around here. You come on along\\n and see the chief.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Brian had had about enough. \\\"I'm not going anywhere to see anybody.\\n Maybe you don't know who I am. You can't arrest me.\\\"\\nBrian Hanson, Chief of Research for Venus Consolidated, as dignified as\\n possible in a damp bathrobe, glared out through the bars at a slightly\\n bewildered Pete Brent.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What the devil do you want? Haven't you caused enough blasted trouble\\n already?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Me? For gosh sakes, chief\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes, you! If sending that damn blonde to my apartment and getting me\\n arrested is your idea of a joke\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"But, my gosh, I didn't send anybody, chief. And this is no joke.\\n That wasn't Myrtle, that was Crystal James, old man James' daughter.\\n They're about the oldest family on Venus. Police have been after her\\n for months; she's a rebel and she's sure been raising plenty of hell\\n around here. She got in and blew out the main communications control\\n panel last night. Communications been tied up all day.\\\" Pete lowered\\n his voice to an appreciative whisper, \\\"Gosh, chief, I didn't know you\\n had it in you. How long have you been in with that bunch? Is that girl\\n as good-looking as they say she is?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Now listen here, Brent. I don't know\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, it's all right, chief. You can trust me. I won't give you away.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"There's nothing to give away, you fool!\\\" Brian bellowed. \\\"I don't know\\n anything about any damn rebels. All I want is to get out of here\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Gotcha, chief,\\\" Brent whispered understandingly. \\\"I'll see if I can\\n pass the word along.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Come here, you idiot!\\\" Brian screamed after his erstwhile assistant.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Pipe down there, bud,\\\" a guard's voice cut in chillingly.\\n\\n\\n Brian retired to his cell bunk and clutched his aching head in\\n frustrated fury.\\n\\n\\n For the nineteenth time Brian Hanson strode to the door of his cell and\\n rattled the bars.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Listen here, guard, you've got to take a message to McHague. You can't\\n hold me here indefinitely.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Shut up. Nobody ain't takin' no message to McHague. I don't care if\\n you are\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n Brian's eyes almost popped out as he saw a gloved hand reach around\\n the guard's neck and jam a rag over his nose and mouth. Swift shadows\\n moved expertly before his astonished gaze. Another guard was caught and\\n silenced as he came around the end of the corridor. Someone was outside\\n his cell door, a hooded figure which seemed, somehow, familiar.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Hello, pantless!\\\" a voice breathed.\\n\\n\\n He knew that voice!\\n\\n\\n \\\"What the devil are you doing here?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Somebody by the name of Pete Brent tipped us off that you were in\\n trouble because of me. But don't worry, we're going to get you out.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Damn that fool kid! Leave me alone. I don't want to get out of here\\n that way!\\\" he yelled wildly. \\\"Guards! Help!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Shut up! Do you want to get us shot?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Sure I do. Guards! Guards!\\\"\\n\\n\\n Someone came running.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Guards are coming,\\\" a voice warned.\\n\\n\\n He could hear the girl struggling with the lock.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Damn,\\\" she swore viciously. \\\"This is the wrong key! Your goose is sure\\n cooked now. Whether you like it or not, you'll hang with us when they\\n find us trying to get you out of here.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Brian felt as though something had kicked him in the stomach. She was\\n right! He had to get out now. He wouldn't be able to explain this away.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Give me that key,\\\" he hissed and grabbed for it.\\n\\n\\n He snapped two of the coigns off in the lock and went to work with the\\n rest of the key. He had designed these escape-proof locks himself. In a\\n few seconds the door swung open and they were fleeing silently down the\\n jail corridor.\\n\\n\\n The girl paused doubtfully at a crossing passage.\\n\\n\\n \\\"This way,\\\" he snarled and took the lead. He knew the ground plan of\\n this jail perfectly. He had a moment of wonder at the crazy spectacle\\n of himself, the fair-haired boy of Venus Consolidated, in his flapping\\n bathrobe, leading a band of escaping rebels out of the company's best\\n jail.\\n\\n\\n They burst around a corner onto a startled guard.\\n\\n\\n \\\"They're just ahead of us,\\\" Brian yelled. \\\"Come on!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Right with you,\\\" the guard snapped and ran a few steps with them\\n before a blackjack caught up with him and he folded into a corner.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Down this way, it's a short cut.\\\" Brian led the way to a heavily\\n barred side door.\\n\\n\\n The electric eye tripped a screaming alarm, but the broken key in\\n Brian's hands opened the complicated lock in a matter of seconds. They\\n were outside the jail on a side street, the door closed and the lock\\n jammed immovably behind them.\\n\\n\\n Sirens wailed. The alarm was out! The street suddenly burst into\\n brilliance as the floodlights snapped on. Brian faltered to a stop and\\n Crystal James pushed past him.\\n\\n\\n \\\"We've got reinforcements down here,\\\" she said, then skidded to a halt.\\n Two guards barred the street ahead of them.\\n\\n\\n Brian felt as though his stomach had fallen down around his ankles\\n and was tying his feet up. He couldn't move. The door was jammed shut\\n behind them, they'd have to surrender and there'd be no explaining\\n this break. He started mentally cursing Pete Brent, when a projector\\n beam slashed viciously by him. These guards weren't fooling! He heard\\n a gasping grunt of pain as one of the rebels went down. They were\\n shooting to kill.\\n\\n\\n He saw a sudden, convulsive movement from the girl. A black object\\n curved out against the lights. The sharp, ripping blast of an atomite\\n bomb thundered along the street and slammed them to the ground. The\\n glare left them blinded. He struggled to his feet. The guards had\\n vanished, a shallow crater yawned in the road where they had been.\\n\\n\\n \\\"We've got to run!\\\" the girl shouted.\\n\\n\\n He started after her. Two surface transport vehicles waited around the\\n corner. Brian and the rebels bundled into them and took away with a\\n roar. The chase wasn't organized yet, and they soon lost themselves in\\n the orderly rush of Venus City traffic.\\nThe two carloads of rebels cruised nonchalantly past the Administration\\n Center and pulled into a private garage a little beyond.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What are we stopping here for?\\\" Brian demanded. \\\"We've got to get\\n away.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's just what we're doing,\\\" Crystal snapped. \\\"Everybody out.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The rebels piled out and the cars pulled away to become innocuous parts\\n of the traffic stream. The rebels seemed to know where they were going\\n and that gave them the edge on Brian. They followed Crystal down into\\n the garage's repair pit.\\n\\n\\n She fumbled in the darkness a moment, then a darker patch showed as\\n a door swung open in the side of the pit. They filed into the solid\\n blackness after her and the door thudded shut. The beam of a torch\\n stabbed through the darkness and they clambered precariously down a\\n steep, steel stairway.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Where the dickens are we?\\\" Brian whispered hoarsely.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, you don't have to whisper, we're safe enough here. This is one of\\n the air shafts leading down to the old mines.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Old mines? What old mines?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's something you newcomers don't know anything about. This whole\\n area was worked out long before Venus Consolidated came to the planet.\\n These old tunnels run all under the city.\\\"\\n\\n\\n They went five hundred feet down the air shaft before they reached a\\n level tunnel.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What do we do? Hide here?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I should say not. Serono Zeburzac, head of McHague's secret police\\n will be after us now. We won't be safe anywhere near Venus City.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Don't be crazy. That Serono Zeburzac stuff is just a legend McHague\\n keeps up to scare people with.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's what you think,\\\" Crystal snapped. \\\"McHague's legend got my\\n father and he'll get all of us unless we run the whole company right\\n off the planet.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, what the dickens does he look like?\\\" Brian asked doubtfully.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I don't know, but his left hand is missing. Dad did some good shooting\\n before he died,\\\" she said grimly.\\n\\n\\n Brian was startled at the icy hardness of her voice.\\n\\n\\n Two of the rebels pulled a screening tarpaulin aside and revealed\\n one of the old-type ore cars that must have been used in the ancient\\n mines. A brand-new atomic motor gleamed incongruously at one end. The\\n rebels crowded into it and they went rumbling swiftly down the echoing\\n passage. The lights of the car showed the old working, rotten and\\n crumbling, fallen in in some places and signs of new work where the\\n rebels had cleared away the debris of years.\\n\\n\\n Brian struggled into a zippered overall suit as they followed a\\n twisting, tortuous course for half an hour, switching from one tunnel\\n to another repeatedly until he had lost all conception of direction.\\n Crystal James, at the controls, seemed to know exactly where they were\\n going.\\n\\n\\n The tunnel emerged in a huge cavern that gloomed darkly away in every\\n direction. The towering, massive remains of old machinery, eroded and\\n rotten with age crouched like ancient, watching skeletons.\\n\\n\\n \\\"These were the old stamp mills,\\\" the girl said, and her voice seemed\\n to be swallowed to a whisper in the vast, echoing darkness.\\n\\n\\n Between two rows of sentinel ruins they came suddenly on two slim\\n Venusian atmospheric ships. Dim light spilled over them from a ragged\\n gash in the wall of the cavern. Brian followed Crystal into the smaller\\n of the two ships and the rest of the rebels manned the other.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Wait a minute, how do we get out of here?\\\" Brian demanded.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Through that hole up there,\\\" the girl said matter-of-factly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You're crazy, you can't get through there.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, yeah? Just watch this.\\\" The ship thundered to life beneath them\\n and leaped off in a full-throttled take-off.\\n\\n\\n \\\"We're going to crash! That gap isn't wide enough!\\\"\\n\\n\\n The sides of the gap rushed in on the tips of the stubby wings. Brian\\n braced himself for the crash, but it didn't come. At the last possible\\n second, the ship rolled smoothly over. At the moment it flashed through\\n the opening it was stood vertically on edge.\\nCrystal held the ship in its roll and completed the maneuver outside\\n the mountain while Brian struggled to get his internal economy back\\n into some semblance of order.\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's some flying,\\\" he said as soon as he could speak.\\n\\n\\n Crystal looked at him in surprise. \\\"That's nothing. We Venusians fly\\n almost as soon as we can walk.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh\\u2014I see,\\\" Brian said weakly and a few moments later he really did\\n see. Two big, fast, green ships, carrying the insignia of the Venus\\n Consolidated police, cruised suddenly out from a mountain air station.\\n\\n\\n An a\\u00ebrial torpedo exploded in front of the rebel ship. Crystal's face\\n set in grim lines as she pulled the ship up in a screaming climb. Brian\\n got up off the floor.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You don't have to get excited like that,\\\" he complained. \\\"They weren't\\n trying to hit us.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's what you think,\\\" Crystal muttered. \\\"Those children don't play\\n for peanuts.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"But, girl, they're just Venus Consolidated police. They haven't got\\n any authority to shoot anyone.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Authority doesn't make much difference to them,\\\" Crystal snapped\\n bitterly. \\\"They've been killing people all over the planet. What do you\\n think this revolution is about?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You must be mistak\\u2014\\\" He slumped to the floor as Crystal threw the\\n ship into a mad, rolling spin. A tremendous crash thundered close\\n astern.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I guess that was a mistake!\\\" Crystal yelled as she fought the controls.\\n\\n\\n Brian almost got to his feet when another wild maneuver hurled him back\\n to the floor. The police ship was right on their tail. The girl gunned\\n her craft into a snap Immelmann and swept back on their pursuers,\\n slicing in close over the ship. Brian's eyes bulged as he saw a long\\n streak of paint and metal ripped off the wing of the police ship. He\\n saw the crew battling their controls in startled terror. The ship\\n slipped frantically away and fell into a spin.\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's them,\\\" Crystal said with satisfaction. \\\"How are the others\\n doing?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Look! They're hit!\\\" Brian felt sick.\\nThe slower rebel freight ship staggered drunkenly as a torpedo caught\\n it and ripped away half a wing. It plunged down in flames with the\\n white flowers of half a dozen parachutes blossoming around it. Brian\\n watched in horror as the police ship came deliberately about. They\\n heard its forward guns go into action. The bodies of the parachutists\\n jerked and jumped like crazy marionettes as the bullets smashed into\\n them. It was over in a few moments. The dead rebels drifted down into\\n the mist-shrouded depths of the valley.\\n\\n\\n \\\"The dirty, murdering rats!\\\" Brian's voice ripped out in a fury of\\n outrage. \\\"They didn't have a chance!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Don't get excited,\\\" Crystal told him in a dead, flat voice. \\\"That's\\n just normal practice. If you'd stuck your nose out of your laboratory\\n once in a while, you'd have heard of these things.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"But why\\u2014\\\" He ducked away instinctively as a flight of bullets spanged\\n through the fuselage. \\\"They're after us now!\\\"\\n\\n\\n Crystal's answer was to yank the ship into a rocketing climb. The\\n police were watching for that. The big ship roared up after them.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Just follow along, suckers,\\\" Crystal invited grimly.\\n\\n\\n She snapped the ship into a whip stall. For one nauseating moment they\\n hung on nothing, then the ship fell over on its back and they screamed\\n down in a terminal velocity dive, heading for the safety of the lower\\n valley mists. The heavier police ship, with its higher wing-loading,\\n could not match the maneuver. The rebel craft plunged down through the\\n blinding fog. Half-seen, ghostly fingers of stone clutched up at them,\\n talons of gray rock missed and fell away again as Crystal nursed the\\n ship out of its dive.\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nPhew!\\n\\\" Brian gasped. \\\"Well, we got away that time. How in thunder\\n can you do it?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, you don't do it on faith. Take a look at that fuel gauge! We\\n may get as far as our headquarters\\u2014or we may not.\\\"\\nFor twenty long minutes they groped blindly through the fog, flying\\n solely by instruments and dead reckoning. The needle of the fuel gauge\\n flickered closer and closer to the danger point. They tore loose from\\n the clinging fog as it swung firmly to \\\"Empty.\\\" The drive sputtered and\\n coughed and died.\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's figuring it nice and close,\\\" Crystal said in satisfaction. \\\"We\\n can glide in from here.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Into where?\\\" Brian demanded. All he could see immediately ahead was\\n the huge bulk of a mountain which blocked the entire width of the\\n valley and soared sheer up to the high-cloud level. His eyes followed\\n it up and up\\u2014\\n\\n\\n \\\"Look! Police ships. They've seen us!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Maybe they haven't. Anyway, there's only one place we can land.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The ship lunged straight for the mountain wall!\\n\\n\\n \\\"Are you crazy? Watch out\\u2014we'll crash!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You leave the flying to me,\\\" Crystal snapped.\\n\\n\\n She held the ship in its glide, aiming directly for the tangled foliage\\n of the mountain face. Brian yelped and cowered instinctively back. The\\n lush green of the mountainside swirled up to meet them. They ripped\\n through the foliage\\u2014there was no crash. They burst through into a\\n huge, brilliantly lighted cavern and settled to a perfect landing. Men\\n came running. Crystal tumbled out of her ship.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Douse those lights,\\\" she shouted. \\\"The police are outside.\\\"\\n\\n\\n A tall, lean man with bulbous eyes and a face like a startled horse,\\n rushed up to Crystal.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What do you mean by leading them here?\\\" he yelled, waving his hands.\\n\\n\\n \\\"They jumped us when we had no fuel, and quit acting like an idiot.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The man was shaking, his eyes looked wild. \\\"They'll kill us. We've got\\n to get out of here.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Wait, you fool. They may not even have seen us.\\\" But he was gone,\\n running toward a group of ships lined up at the end of the cavern.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Who was that crazy coot and what is this place?\\\" Brian demanded.\\n\\n\\n \\\"That was Gort Sterling, our leader,\\\" the girl said bitterly. \\\"And\\n this is our headquarters.\\\" One of the ships at the back of the cavern\\n thundered to life, streaked across the floor and burst out through the\\n opening Crystal's ship had left. \\\"He hasn't got a chance! We'll be\\n spotted for sure, now.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The other rebels waited uncertainly, but not for long. There was the\\n crescendoing roar of ships in a dive followed by the terrific crash of\\n an explosion.\\n\\n\\n \\\"They got him!\\\" Crystal's voice was a moan. \\\"Oh, the fool, the fool!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Sounded like more than one ship. They'll be after us, now. Is there\\n any other way of getting out of this place?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Not for ships. We'll have to walk and they'll follow us.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"We've got to slow them down some way, then. I wonder how the devil\\n they traced us? I thought we lost them in that fog.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It's that Serono Zeburzac, the traitor. He knows these mountains as\\n well as we do.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"How come?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"The Zeburzacs are one of the old families, but he sold out to McHague.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, what do we do now? Just stand here? It looks like everybody's\\n leaving.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"We might as well just wait,\\\" Crystal said hopelessly. \\\"It won't do us\\n any good to run out into the hills. Zeburzac and his men will follow.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"We could slow them down some by swinging a couple of those ships\\n around so their rocket exhausts sweep the entrance to the cavern,\\\"\\n Brian suggested doubtfully. She looked at him steadily.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You sound like the only good rebel left. We can try it, anyway.\\\"\\nThey ran two ships out into the middle of the cavern, gunned them\\n around and jockeyed them into position\\u2014not a moment too soon.\\n\\n\\n Half a dozen police showed in brief silhouette as they slipped\\n cautiously into the cavern, guns ready, expecting resistance. They met\\n a dead silence. A score or more followed them without any attempt at\\n concealment. Then Brian and Crystal cut loose with the drives of the\\n two ships.\\n\\n\\n Startled screams of agony burst from the crowded group of police as\\n they were caught in the annihilating cross fire of roaring flame.\\n They crisped and twisted, cooked to scorched horrors before they\\n fell. A burst of thick, greasy smoke rushed out of the cavern. Two of\\n the police, their clothes and flesh scorched and flaming, plunged as\\n shrieking, living torches down the mountainside.\\n\\n\\n Crystal was white and shaking, her face set in a mask of horror, as she\\n climbed blindly from her ship.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Let's get away! I can smell them burning,\\\" she shuddered and covered\\n her face with her hands.\\n\\n\\n Brian grabbed her and shook her.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Snap out of it,\\\" he barked. \\\"That's no worse than shooting helpless\\n men in parachutes. We can't go, yet; we're not finished here.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, let them shoot us! I can't go through that again!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You don't have to. Wait here.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He climbed back into one of the ships and cut the richness of the fuel\\n mixture down till the exhaust was a lambent, shuddering stutter,\\n verging on extinction. He dashed to the other ship and repeated the\\n maneuver, fussing with the throttle till he had the fuel mixture\\n adjusted to critical fineness. The beat of the stuttering exhaust\\n seemed to catch up to the other and built to an aching pulsation. In\\n a moment the whole mass of air in the cavern hit the frequency with a\\n subtle, intangible thunder of vibration.\\n\\n\\n Crystal screamed. \\\"Brian! There's more police cutting in around the\\n entrance.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Brian clambered out of the ship and glanced at the glowing points\\n in the rock where the police were cutting their way through outside\\n the line of the exhaust flames. The pulsating thunder in the cavern\\n crescendoed to an intolerable pitch. A huge mass of stalactites crashed\\n to the floor.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It's time to check out,\\\" Brian shouted.\\n\\n\\n Crystal led the way as they fled down the escape tunnel. The roaring\\n crash of falling rock was a continuous, increasing avalanche of sound\\n in the cavern behind them.\\n\\n\\n They emerged from the tunnel on the face of the mountain, several\\n hundred yards to the east of the cavern entrance. The ground shook and\\n heaved beneath them.\\n\\n\\n \\\"The whole side of the mountain's sliding,\\\" Crystal screamed.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Run!\\\" Brian shoved her and they plunged madly through the thick tangle\\n of jungle away from the slide.\\n\\n\\n Huge boulders leaped and smashed through the matted bush around them.\\n Crystal went down as the ground slipped from under her. Brian grabbed\\n her and a tree at the same time. The tree leaned and crashed down the\\n slope, the whole jungle muttered and groaned and came to life as it\\n joined the roaring rush of the slide. They were tumbled irresistibly\\n downward, riding the edge of the slide for terrifying minutes till\\n it stilled and left them bruised and shaken in a tangle of torn\\n vegetation.\\n\\n\\n The remains of two police ships, caught without warning in the rush as\\n they attempted to land, stuck up grotesquely out of the foot of the\\n slide. The dust was settling away. A flock of brilliant blue, gliding\\n lizards barking in raucous terror, fled down the valley. Then they were\\n gone and the primeval silence settled back into place.\\n\\n\\n Brian and Crystal struggled painfully to solid ground. Crystal gazed\\n with a feeling of awe at the devastated mountainside.\\n\\n\\n \\\"How did you do it?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It's a matter of harmonics,\\\" Brian explained. \\\"If you hit the right\\n vibratory combination, you can shake anything down. But now that we've\\n made a mess of the old homestead, what do we do?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Walk,\\\" Crystal said laconically. She led the way as they started\\n scrambling through the jungle up the mountainside.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Where are we heading for?\\\" Brian grunted as he struggled along.\\n\\n\\n \\\"The headquarters of the Carlton family. They're the closest people we\\n can depend on. They've kept out of the rebellion, but they're on our\\n side.

Gonna quit now?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Brian Hanson looked disgustedly at Pete Brent, his lanky assistant.\\n That was the first sign of animation he had displayed all day.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I am, but you're not,\\\" Hanson told him grimly. \\\"Get your notes\\n straightened up. Run those centrifuge tests and set up the still so we\\n can get at that vitamin count early in the morning.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Tomorrow morning? Aw, for gosh sakes, chief, why don't you take a day\\n off sometime, or better yet, a night off. It'd do you good to relax.\\n Boy, I know a swell blonde you could go for. Wait a minute, I've got\\n her radiophone number somewhere\\u2014just ask for Myrtle.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Hanson shrugged himself out of his smock.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Never mind Myrtle, just have that equipment set up for the morning.\\n Good night.\\\" He strode out of the huge laboratory, but his mind was\\n still on the vitamin research they had been conducting, he barely heard\\n the remarks that followed him.\\n\\n\\n \\\"One of these days the chief is going to have his glands catch up with\\n him.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Not a chance,\\\" Pete Brent grunted.\\n\\n\\n Brian Hanson wondered dispassionately for a moment how his assistants\\n could fail to be as absorbed as he was by the work they were doing,\\n then he let it go as he stepped outside the research building.\\n\\n\\n He paused and let his eyes lift to the buildings that surrounded the\\n compound. This was the administrative heart of Venus City. Out here,\\n alone, he let his only known emotion sweep through him, pride. He had\\n an important role in the building of this great new city. As head of\\n the Venus Consolidated Research Organization, he was in large part\\n responsible for the prosperity of this vigorous, young world. Venus\\n Consolidated had built up this city and practically everything else\\n that amounted to anything on this planet. True, there had been others,\\n pioneers, before the company came, who objected to the expansion of the\\n monopolistic control. But, if they could not realize that the company's\\n regime served the best interests of the planet, they would just have to\\n suffer the consequences of their own ignorance. There had been rumors\\n of revolution among the disgruntled older families.\\n\\n\\n He heard there had been killings, but that was nonsense. Venus\\n Consolidated police had only powers of arrest. Anything involving\\n executions had to be referred to the Interplanetary Council on Earth.\\n He dismissed the whole business as he did everything else that did not\\n directly influence his own department.\\n\\n\\n He ignored the surface transport system and walked to his own\\n apartment. This walk was part of a regular routine of physical exercise\\n that kept his body hard and resilient in spite of long hours spent in\\n the laboratory. As he opened the door of his apartment he heard the\\n water running into his bath. Perfect timing. He was making that walk\\n in precisely seven minutes, four and four-fifths seconds. He undressed\\n and climbed into the tub, relaxing luxuriously in the exhilaration of\\n irradiated water.\\n\\n\\n He let all the problems of his work drift away, his mind was a peaceful\\n blank. Then someone was hammering on his head. He struggled reluctantly\\n awake. It was the door that was being attacked, not his head. The\\n battering thunder continued persistently. He swore and sat up.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What do you want?\\\"\\n\\n\\n There was no answer; the hammering continued.\\n\\n\\n \\\"All right! All right! I'm coming!\\\" He yelled, crawled out of the tub\\n and reached for his bathrobe. It wasn't there. He swore some more and\\n grabbed a towel, wrapping it inadequately around him; it didn't quite\\n meet astern. He paddled wetly across the floor sounding like a flock of\\n ducks on parade.\\n\\n\\n Retaining the towel with one hand he inched the door cautiously open.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What the devil\\u2014\\\" He stopped abruptly at the sight of a policeman's\\n uniform.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Sorry, sir, but one of those rebels is loose in the Administration\\n Center somewhere. We're making a check-up of all the apartments.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, you can check out; I haven't got any blasted rebels in here.\\\"\\n The policeman's face hardened, then relaxed knowingly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, I see, sir. No rebels, of course. Sorry to have disturbed you.\\n Have a good\\u2014Good night, sir,\\\" he saluted and left.\\n\\n\\n Brian closed the door in puzzlement. What the devil had that flat-foot\\n been smirking about? Well, maybe he could get his bath now.\\nHanson turned away from the door and froze in amazement. Through the\\n open door of his bedroom he could see his bed neatly turned down as\\n it should be, but the outline under the counterpane and the luxuriant\\n mass of platinum-blond hair on the pillow was certainly no part of his\\n regular routine.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Hello.\\\" The voice matched the calm alertness of a pair of deep-blue\\n eyes. Brian just stared at her in numbed fascination. That was what the\\n policeman had meant with his insinuating smirk.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Just ask for Myrtle.\\\" Pete Brent's joking words flashed back to him.\\n Now he got it. This was probably the young fool's idea of a joke. He'd\\n soon fix that.\\n\\n\\n \\\"All right, joke's over, you can beat it now.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Joke? I don't see anything funny, unless it's you and that suggestive\\n towel. You should either abandon it or get one that goes all the way\\n round.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Brian slowly acquired a complexion suitable for painting fire plugs.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Shut up and throw me my dressing gown.\\\" He gritted.\\n\\n\\n The girl swung her legs out of bed and Brian blinked; she was fully\\n dressed. The snug, zippered overall suit she wore did nothing to\\n conceal the fact that she was a female. He wrapped his bathrobe\\n austerely around him.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, now what?\\\" she asked and looked at him questioningly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, what do you think?\\\" he burst out angrily. \\\"I'm going to finish\\n my bath and I'd suggest you go down to the laboratory and hold hands\\n with Pete. He'd appreciate it.\\\" He got the impression that the girl was\\n struggling heroically to refrain from laughing and that didn't help his\\n dignity any. He strode into the bathroom, slammed the door and climbed\\n back into the bath.\\n\\n\\n The door opened a little.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, good-by now.\\\" The girl said sweetly. \\\"Remember me to the police\\n force.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Get out of here!\\\" he yelled and the door shut abruptly on a rippling\\n burst of laughter. Damn women! It was getting so a man had to pack\\n a gun with him or something. And Pete Brent. He thought with grim\\n satisfaction of the unending extra work that was going to occur around\\n the laboratory from now on. He sank back into the soothing liquid\\n embrace of the bath and deliberately set his mind loose to wander in\\n complete relaxation.\\n\\n\\n A hammering thunder burst on the outer door. He sat up with a groan.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Lay off, you crazy apes!\\\" he yelled furiously, but the pounding\\n continued steadily. He struggled out of the bath, wrapped his damp\\n bathrobe clammily around him and marched to the door with a seething\\n fury of righteous anger burning within him. He flung the door wide, his\\n mouth all set for a withering barrage, but he didn't get a chance. Four\\n police constables and a sergeant swarmed into the room, shoving him\\n away from the door.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Say! What the\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Where is she?\\\" the sergeant demanded.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Wherethehell's who?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Quit stallin', bud. You know who. That female rebel who was in here.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Rebel? You're crazy! That was just ... Pete said ... rebel? Did you\\n say rebel?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yeah, I said rebel, an' where is she?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"She ... why ... why ... she left, of course. You don't think I was\\n going to have women running around in here, do you?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"She wuz in his bed when I seen her, sarge,\\\" one of the guards\\n contributed. \\\"But she ain't there now.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You don't think that I\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Listen, bud, we don't do the thinkin' around here. You come on along\\n and see the chief.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Brian had had about enough. \\\"I'm not going anywhere to see anybody.\\n Maybe you don't know who I am. You can't arrest me.\\\"\\nBrian Hanson, Chief of Research for Venus Consolidated, as dignified as\\n possible in a damp bathrobe, glared out through the bars at a slightly\\n bewildered Pete Brent.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What the devil do you want? Haven't you caused enough blasted trouble\\n already?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Me? For gosh sakes, chief\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes, you! If sending that damn blonde to my apartment and getting me\\n arrested is your idea of a joke\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"But, my gosh, I didn't send anybody, chief. And this is no joke.\\n That wasn't Myrtle, that was Crystal James, old man James' daughter.\\n They're about the oldest family on Venus. Police have been after her\\n for months; she's a rebel and she's sure been raising plenty of hell\\n around here. She got in and blew out the main communications control\\n panel last night. Communications been tied up all day.\\\" Pete lowered\\n his voice to an appreciative whisper, \\\"Gosh, chief, I didn't know you\\n had it in you. How long have you been in with that bunch? Is that girl\\n as good-looking as they say she is?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Now listen here, Brent. I don't know\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, it's all right, chief. You can trust me. I won't give you away.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"There's nothing to give away, you fool!\\\" Brian bellowed. \\\"I don't know\\n anything about any damn rebels. All I want is to get out of here\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Gotcha, chief,\\\" Brent whispered understandingly. \\\"I'll see if I can\\n pass the word along.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Come here, you idiot!\\\" Brian screamed after his erstwhile assistant.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Pipe down there, bud,\\\" a guard's voice cut in chillingly.\\n\\n\\n Brian retired to his cell bunk and clutched his aching head in\\n frustrated fury.\\n\\n\\n For the nineteenth time Brian Hanson strode to the door of his cell and\\n rattled the bars.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Listen here, guard, you've got to take a message to McHague. You can't\\n hold me here indefinitely.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Shut up. Nobody ain't takin' no message to McHague. I don't care if\\n you are\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n Brian's eyes almost popped out as he saw a gloved hand reach around\\n the guard's neck and jam a rag over his nose and mouth. Swift shadows\\n moved expertly before his astonished gaze. Another guard was caught and\\n silenced as he came around the end of the corridor. Someone was outside\\n his cell door, a hooded figure which seemed, somehow, familiar.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Hello, pantless!\\\" a voice breathed.\\n\\n\\n He knew that voice!\\n\\n\\n \\\"What the devil are you doing here?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Somebody by the name of Pete Brent tipped us off that you were in\\n trouble because of me. But don't worry, we're going to get you out.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Damn that fool kid! Leave me alone. I don't want to get out of here\\n that way!\\\" he yelled wildly. \\\"Guards! Help!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Shut up! Do you want to get us shot?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Sure I do. Guards! Guards!\\\"\\n\\n\\n Someone came running.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Guards are coming,\\\" a voice warned.\\n\\n\\n He could hear the girl struggling with the lock.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Damn,\\\" she swore viciously. \\\"This is the wrong key! Your goose is sure\\n cooked now. Whether you like it or not, you'll hang with us when they\\n find us trying to get you out of here.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Brian felt as though something had kicked him in the stomach. She was\\n right! He had to get out now. He wouldn't be able to explain this away.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Give me that key,\\\" he hissed and grabbed for it.\\n\\n\\n He snapped two of the coigns off in the lock and went to work with the\\n rest of the key. He had designed these escape-proof locks himself. In a\\n few seconds the door swung open and they were fleeing silently down the\\n jail corridor.\\n\\n\\n The girl paused doubtfully at a crossing passage.\\n\\n\\n \\\"This way,\\\" he snarled and took the lead. He knew the ground plan of\\n this jail perfectly. He had a moment of wonder at the crazy spectacle\\n of himself, the fair-haired boy of Venus Consolidated, in his flapping\\n bathrobe, leading a band of escaping rebels out of the company's best\\n jail.\\n\\n\\n They burst around a corner onto a startled guard.\\n\\n\\n \\\"They're just ahead of us,\\\" Brian yelled. \\\"Come on!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Right with you,\\\" the guard snapped and ran a few steps with them\\n before a blackjack caught up with him and he folded into a corner.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Down this way, it's a short cut.\\\" Brian led the way to a heavily\\n barred side door.\\n\\n\\n The electric eye tripped a screaming alarm, but the broken key in\\n Brian's hands opened the complicated lock in a matter of seconds. They\\n were outside the jail on a side street, the door closed and the lock\\n jammed immovably behind them.\\n\\n\\n Sirens wailed. The alarm was out! The street suddenly burst into\\n brilliance as the floodlights snapped on. Brian faltered to a stop and\\n Crystal James pushed past him.\\n\\n\\n \\\"We've got reinforcements down here,\\\" she said, then skidded to a halt.\\n Two guards barred the street ahead of them.\\n\\n\\n Brian felt as though his stomach had fallen down around his ankles\\n and was tying his feet up. He couldn't move. The door was jammed shut\\n behind them, they'd have to surrender and there'd be no explaining\\n this break. He started mentally cursing Pete Brent, when a projector\\n beam slashed viciously by him. These guards weren't fooling! He heard\\n a gasping grunt of pain as one of the rebels went down. They were\\n shooting to kill.\\n\\n\\n He saw a sudden, convulsive movement from the girl. A black object\\n curved out against the lights. The sharp, ripping blast of an atomite\\n bomb thundered along the street and slammed them to the ground. The\\n glare left them blinded. He struggled to his feet. The guards had\\n vanished, a shallow crater yawned in the road where they had been.\\n\\n\\n \\\"We've got to run!\\\" the girl shouted.\\n\\n\\n He started after her. Two surface transport vehicles waited around the\\n corner. Brian and the rebels bundled into them and took away with a\\n roar. The chase wasn't organized yet, and they soon lost themselves in\\n the orderly rush of Venus City traffic.\\nThe two carloads of rebels cruised nonchalantly past the Administration\\n Center and pulled into a private garage a little beyond.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What are we stopping here for?\\\" Brian demanded. \\\"We've got to get\\n away.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's just what we're doing,\\\" Crystal snapped. \\\"Everybody out.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The rebels piled out and the cars pulled away to become innocuous parts\\n of the traffic stream. The rebels seemed to know where they were going\\n and that gave them the edge on Brian. They followed Crystal down into\\n the garage's repair pit.\\n\\n\\n She fumbled in the darkness a moment, then a darker patch showed as\\n a door swung open in the side of the pit. They filed into the solid\\n blackness after her and the door thudded shut. The beam of a torch\\n stabbed through the darkness and they clambered precariously down a\\n steep, steel stairway.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Where the dickens are we?\\\" Brian whispered hoarsely.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, you don't have to whisper, we're safe enough here. This is one of\\n the air shafts leading down to the old mines.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Old mines? What old mines?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's something you newcomers don't know anything about. This whole\\n area was worked out long before Venus Consolidated came to the planet.\\n These old tunnels run all under the city.\\\"\\n\\n\\n They went five hundred feet down the air shaft before they reached a\\n level tunnel.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What do we do? Hide here?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I should say not. Serono Zeburzac, head of McHague's secret police\\n will be after us now. We won't be safe anywhere near Venus City.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Don't be crazy. That Serono Zeburzac stuff is just a legend McHague\\n keeps up to scare people with.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's what you think,\\\" Crystal snapped. \\\"McHague's legend got my\\n father and he'll get all of us unless we run the whole company right\\n off the planet.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, what the dickens does he look like?\\\" Brian asked doubtfully.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I don't know, but his left hand is missing. Dad did some good shooting\\n before he died,\\\" she said grimly.\\n\\n\\n Brian was startled at the icy hardness of her voice.\\n\\n\\n Two of the rebels pulled a screening tarpaulin aside and revealed\\n one of the old-type ore cars that must have been used in the ancient\\n mines. A brand-new atomic motor gleamed incongruously at one end. The\\n rebels crowded into it and they went rumbling swiftly down the echoing\\n passage. The lights of the car showed the old working, rotten and\\n crumbling, fallen in in some places and signs of new work where the\\n rebels had cleared away the debris of years.\\n\\n\\n Brian struggled into a zippered overall suit as they followed a\\n twisting, tortuous course for half an hour, switching from one tunnel\\n to another repeatedly until he had lost all conception of direction.\\n Crystal James, at the controls, seemed to know exactly where they were\\n going.\\n\\n\\n The tunnel emerged in a huge cavern that gloomed darkly away in every\\n direction. The towering, massive remains of old machinery, eroded and\\n rotten with age crouched like ancient, watching skeletons.\\n\\n\\n \\\"These were the old stamp mills,\\\" the girl said, and her voice seemed\\n to be swallowed to a whisper in the vast, echoing darkness.\\n\\n\\n Between two rows of sentinel ruins they came suddenly on two slim\\n Venusian atmospheric ships. Dim light spilled over them from a ragged\\n gash in the wall of the cavern. Brian followed Crystal into the smaller\\n of the two ships and the rest of the rebels manned the other.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Wait a minute, how do we get out of here?\\\" Brian demanded.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Through that hole up there,\\\" the girl said matter-of-factly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You're crazy, you can't get through there.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, yeah? Just watch this.\\\" The ship thundered to life beneath them\\n and leaped off in a full-throttled take-off.\\n\\n\\n \\\"We're going to crash! That gap isn't wide enough!\\\"\\n\\n\\n The sides of the gap rushed in on the tips of the stubby wings. Brian\\n braced himself for the crash, but it didn't come. At the last possible\\n second, the ship rolled smoothly over. At the moment it flashed through\\n the opening it was stood vertically on edge.\\nCrystal held the ship in its roll and completed the maneuver outside\\n the mountain while Brian struggled to get his internal economy back\\n into some semblance of order.\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's some flying,\\\" he said as soon as he could speak.\\n\\n\\n Crystal looked at him in surprise. \\\"That's nothing. We Venusians fly\\n almost as soon as we can walk.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh\\u2014I see,\\\" Brian said weakly and a few moments later he really did\\n see. Two big, fast, green ships, carrying the insignia of the Venus\\n Consolidated police, cruised suddenly out from a mountain air station.\\n\\n\\n An a\\u00ebrial torpedo exploded in front of the rebel ship. Crystal's face\\n set in grim lines as she pulled the ship up in a screaming climb. Brian\\n got up off the floor.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You don't have to get excited like that,\\\" he complained. \\\"They weren't\\n trying to hit us.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's what you think,\\\" Crystal muttered. \\\"Those children don't play\\n for peanuts.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"But, girl, they're just Venus Consolidated police. They haven't got\\n any authority to shoot anyone.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Authority doesn't make much difference to them,\\\" Crystal snapped\\n bitterly. \\\"They've been killing people all over the planet. What do you\\n think this revolution is about?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You must be mistak\\u2014\\\" He slumped to the floor as Crystal threw the\\n ship into a mad, rolling spin. A tremendous crash thundered close\\n astern.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I guess that was a mistake!\\\" Crystal yelled as she fought the controls.\\n\\n\\n Brian almost got to his feet when another wild maneuver hurled him back\\n to the floor. The police ship was right on their tail. The girl gunned\\n her craft into a snap Immelmann and swept back on their pursuers,\\n slicing in close over the ship. Brian's eyes bulged as he saw a long\\n streak of paint and metal ripped off the wing of the police ship. He\\n saw the crew battling their controls in startled terror. The ship\\n slipped frantically away and fell into a spin.\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's them,\\\" Crystal said with satisfaction. \\\"How are the others\\n doing?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Look! They're hit!\\\" Brian felt sick.\\nThe slower rebel freight ship staggered drunkenly as a torpedo caught\\n it and ripped away half a wing. It plunged down in flames with the\\n white flowers of half a dozen parachutes blossoming around it. Brian\\n watched in horror as the police ship came deliberately about. They\\n heard its forward guns go into action. The bodies of the parachutists\\n jerked and jumped like crazy marionettes as the bullets smashed into\\n them. It was over in a few moments. The dead rebels drifted down into\\n the mist-shrouded depths of the valley.\\n\\n\\n \\\"The dirty, murdering rats!\\\" Brian's voice ripped out in a fury of\\n outrage. \\\"They didn't have a chance!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Don't get excited,\\\" Crystal told him in a dead, flat voice. \\\"That's\\n just normal practice. If you'd stuck your nose out of your laboratory\\n once in a while, you'd have heard of these things.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"But why\\u2014\\\" He ducked away instinctively as a flight of bullets spanged\\n through the fuselage. \\\"They're after us now!\\\"\\n\\n\\n Crystal's answer was to yank the ship into a rocketing climb. The\\n police were watching for that. The big ship roared up after them.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Just follow along, suckers,\\\" Crystal invited grimly.\\n\\n\\n She snapped the ship into a whip stall. For one nauseating moment they\\n hung on nothing, then the ship fell over on its back and they screamed\\n down in a terminal velocity dive, heading for the safety of the lower\\n valley mists. The heavier police ship, with its higher wing-loading,\\n could not match the maneuver. The rebel craft plunged down through the\\n blinding fog. Half-seen, ghostly fingers of stone clutched up at them,\\n talons of gray rock missed and fell away again as Crystal nursed the\\n ship out of its dive.\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nPhew!\\n\\\" Brian gasped. \\\"Well, we got away that time. How in thunder\\n can you do it?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, you don't do it on faith. Take a look at that fuel gauge! We\\n may get as far as our headquarters\\u2014or we may not.\\\"\\nFor twenty long minutes they groped blindly through the fog, flying\\n solely by instruments and dead reckoning. The needle of the fuel gauge\\n flickered closer and closer to the danger point. They tore loose from\\n the clinging fog as it swung firmly to \\\"Empty.\\\" The drive sputtered and\\n coughed and died.\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's figuring it nice and close,\\\" Crystal said in satisfaction. \\\"We\\n can glide in from here.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Into where?\\\" Brian demanded. All he could see immediately ahead was\\n the huge bulk of a mountain which blocked the entire width of the\\n valley and soared sheer up to the high-cloud level. His eyes followed\\n it up and up\\u2014\\n\\n\\n \\\"Look! Police ships. They've seen us!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Maybe they haven't. Anyway, there's only one place we can land.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The ship lunged straight for the mountain wall!\\n\\n\\n \\\"Are you crazy? Watch out\\u2014we'll crash!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You leave the flying to me,\\\" Crystal snapped.\\n\\n\\n She held the ship in its glide, aiming directly for the tangled foliage\\n of the mountain face. Brian yelped and cowered instinctively back. The\\n lush green of the mountainside swirled up to meet them. They ripped\\n through the foliage\\u2014there was no crash. They burst through into a\\n huge, brilliantly lighted cavern and settled to a perfect landing. Men\\n came running. Crystal tumbled out of her ship.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Douse those lights,\\\" she shouted. \\\"The police are outside.\\\"\\n\\n\\n A tall, lean man with bulbous eyes and a face like a startled horse,\\n rushed up to Crystal.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What do you mean by leading them here?\\\" he yelled, waving his hands.\\n\\n\\n \\\"They jumped us when we had no fuel, and quit acting like an idiot.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The man was shaking, his eyes looked wild. \\\"They'll kill us. We've got\\n to get out of here.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Wait, you fool. They may not even have seen us.\\\" But he was gone,\\n running toward a group of ships lined up at the end of the cavern.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Who was that crazy coot and what is this place?\\\" Brian demanded.\\n\\n\\n \\\"That was Gort Sterling, our leader,\\\" the girl said bitterly. \\\"And\\n this is our headquarters.\\\" One of the ships at the back of the cavern\\n thundered to life, streaked across the floor and burst out through the\\n opening Crystal's ship had left. \\\"He hasn't got a chance! We'll be\\n spotted for sure, now.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The other rebels waited uncertainly, but not for long. There was the\\n crescendoing roar of ships in a dive followed by the terrific crash of\\n an explosion.\\n\\n\\n \\\"They got him!\\\" Crystal's voice was a moan. \\\"Oh, the fool, the fool!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Sounded like more than one ship. They'll be after us, now. Is there\\n any other way of getting out of this place?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Not for ships. We'll have to walk and they'll follow us.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"We've got to slow them down some way, then. I wonder how the devil\\n they traced us? I thought we lost them in that fog.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It's that Serono Zeburzac, the traitor. He knows these mountains as\\n well as we do.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"How come?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"The Zeburzacs are one of the old families, but he sold out to McHague.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, what do we do now? Just stand here? It looks like everybody's\\n leaving.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"We might as well just wait,\\\" Crystal said hopelessly. \\\"It won't do us\\n any good to run out into the hills. Zeburzac and his men will follow.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"We could slow them down some by swinging a couple of those ships\\n around so their rocket exhausts sweep the entrance to the cavern,\\\"\\n Brian suggested doubtfully. She looked at him steadily.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You sound like the only good rebel left. We can try it, anyway.\\\"\\nThey ran two ships out into the middle of the cavern, gunned them\\n around and jockeyed them into position\\u2014not a moment too soon.\\n\\n\\n Half a dozen police showed in brief silhouette as they slipped\\n cautiously into the cavern, guns ready, expecting resistance. They met\\n a dead silence. A score or more followed them without any attempt at\\n concealment. Then Brian and Crystal cut loose with the drives of the\\n two ships.\\n\\n\\n Startled screams of agony burst from the crowded group of police as\\n they were caught in the annihilating cross fire of roaring flame.\\n They crisped and twisted, cooked to scorched horrors before they\\n fell.

A huge mass of stalactites crashed\\n to the floor.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It's time to check out,\\\" Brian shouted.\\n\\n\\n Crystal led the way as they fled down the escape tunnel.

Brian grabbed\\n her and a tree at the same time. The tree leaned and crashed down the\\n slope, the whole jungle muttered and groaned and came to life as it\\n joined the roaring rush of the slide.

The dust was settling away. A flock of brilliant blue, gliding\\n lizards barking in raucous terror, fled down the valley. Then they were\\n gone and the primeval silence settled back into place.\\n\\n\\n Brian and Crystal struggled painfully to solid ground. Crystal gazed\\n with a feeling of awe at the devastated mountainside.\\n\\n\\n \\\"How did you do it?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It's a matter of harmonics,\\\" Brian explained. \\\"If you hit the right\\n vibratory combination, you can shake anything down. But now that we've\\n made a mess of the old homestead, what do we do?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Walk,\\\" Crystal said laconically. She led the way as they started\\n scrambling through the jungle up the mountainside.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Where are we heading for?\\\" Brian grunted as he struggled along.\\n\\n\\n \\\"The headquarters of the Carlton family.

Furthermore, his bewilderment and the desperate nature of his actions, seen when he questions, <quote>\"What do we do? Hide here?\"</quote> highlight his lost direction and disillusionment.

The opponent claims Brian's actions signify a moral shift, focusing on his participation with the rebels and his outrage at the police's brutality, suggesting a transition from obliviousness to moral responsibility. 2. To counter this, I should emphasize that Brian's actions are primarily reactionary and driven by a lack of alternatives, not a moral awakening. His uncertainty and lack of clear purpose indicate a loss of hope rather than a shift in morality. 3. Brian's statement <quote>\"What do we do?

Initially proud of his role, as seen when he <quote>\"let his only known emotion sweep through him, pride,\"</quote> Brian's disillusionment grows upon witnessing the company's brutality.

Gonna quit now?\\\"\\n\\n\\n Brian Hanson looked disgustedly at Pete Brent, his lanky assistant.\\n That was the first sign of animation he had displayed all day.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I am, but you're not,\\\" Hanson told him grimly. \\\"Get your notes\\n straightened up. Run those centrifuge tests and set up the still so we\\n can get at that vitamin count early in the morning.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Tomorrow morning? Aw, for gosh sakes, chief, why don't you take a day\\n off sometime, or better yet, a night off. It'd do you good to relax.\\n Boy, I know a swell blonde you could go for. Wait a minute, I've got\\n her radiophone number somewhere\\u2014just ask for Myrtle.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Hanson shrugged himself out of his smock.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Never mind Myrtle, just have that equipment set up for the morning.\\n Good night.\\\" He strode out of the huge laboratory, but his mind was\\n still on the vitamin research they had been conducting, he barely heard\\n the remarks that followed him.\\n\\n\\n \\\"One of these days the chief is going to have his glands catch up with\\n him.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Not a chance,\\\" Pete Brent grunted.\\n\\n\\n Brian Hanson wondered dispassionately for a moment how his assistants\\n could fail to be as absorbed as he was by the work they were doing,\\n then he let it go as he stepped outside the research building.\\n\\n\\n He paused and let his eyes lift to the buildings that surrounded the\\n compound. This was the administrative heart of Venus City. Out here,\\n alone, he let his only known emotion sweep through him, pride. He had\\n an important role in the building of this great new city. As head of\\n the Venus Consolidated Research Organization, he was in large part\\n responsible for the prosperity of this vigorous, young world. Venus\\n Consolidated had built up this city and practically everything else\\n that amounted to anything on this planet. True, there had been others,\\n pioneers, before the company came, who objected to the expansion of the\\n monopolistic control. But, if they could not realize that the company's\\n regime served the best interests of the planet, they would just have to\\n suffer the consequences of their own ignorance. There had been rumors\\n of revolution among the disgruntled older families.\\n\\n\\n He heard there had been killings, but that was nonsense. Venus\\n Consolidated police had only powers of arrest. Anything involving\\n executions had to be referred to the Interplanetary Council on Earth.\\n He dismissed the whole business as he did everything else that did not\\n directly influence his own department.\\n\\n\\n He ignored the surface transport system and walked to his own\\n apartment. This walk was part of a regular routine of physical exercise\\n that kept his body hard and resilient in spite of long hours spent in\\n the laboratory. As he opened the door of his apartment he heard the\\n water running into his bath. Perfect timing. He was making that walk\\n in precisely seven minutes, four and four-fifths seconds. He undressed\\n and climbed into the tub, relaxing luxuriously in the exhilaration of\\n irradiated water.\\n\\n\\n He let all the problems of his work drift away, his mind was a peaceful\\n blank. Then someone was hammering on his head. He struggled reluctantly\\n awake. It was the door that was being attacked, not his head. The\\n battering thunder continued persistently. He swore and sat up.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What do you want?\\\"\\n\\n\\n There was no answer; the hammering continued.\\n\\n\\n \\\"All right! All right! I'm coming!\\\" He yelled, crawled out of the tub\\n and reached for his bathrobe. It wasn't there. He swore some more and\\n grabbed a towel, wrapping it inadequately around him; it didn't quite\\n meet astern. He paddled wetly across the floor sounding like a flock of\\n ducks on parade.\\n\\n\\n Retaining the towel with one hand he inched the door cautiously open.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What the devil\\u2014\\\" He stopped abruptly at the sight of a policeman's\\n uniform.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Sorry, sir, but one of those rebels is loose in the Administration\\n Center somewhere. We're making a check-up of all the apartments.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, you can check out; I haven't got any blasted rebels in here.\\\"\\n The policeman's face hardened, then relaxed knowingly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, I see, sir. No rebels, of course. Sorry to have disturbed you.\\n Have a good\\u2014Good night, sir,\\\" he saluted and left.\\n\\n\\n Brian closed the door in puzzlement. What the devil had that flat-foot\\n been smirking about? Well, maybe he could get his bath now.\\nHanson turned away from the door and froze in amazement. Through the\\n open door of his bedroom he could see his bed neatly turned down as\\n it should be, but the outline under the counterpane and the luxuriant\\n mass of platinum-blond hair on the pillow was certainly no part of his\\n regular routine.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Hello.\\\" The voice matched the calm alertness of a pair of deep-blue\\n eyes. Brian just stared at her in numbed fascination. That was what the\\n policeman had meant with his insinuating smirk.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Just ask for Myrtle.\\\" Pete Brent's joking words flashed back to him.\\n Now he got it. This was probably the young fool's idea of a joke. He'd\\n soon fix that.\\n\\n\\n \\\"All right, joke's over, you can beat it now.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Joke? I don't see anything funny, unless it's you and that suggestive\\n towel. You should either abandon it or get one that goes all the way\\n round.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Brian slowly acquired a complexion suitable for painting fire plugs.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Shut up and throw me my dressing gown.\\\" He gritted.\\n\\n\\n The girl swung her legs out of bed and Brian blinked; she was fully\\n dressed. The snug, zippered overall suit she wore did nothing to\\n conceal the fact that she was a female. He wrapped his bathrobe\\n austerely around him.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, now what?\\\" she asked and looked at him questioningly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, what do you think?\\\" he burst out angrily. \\\"I'm going to finish\\n my bath and I'd suggest you go down to the laboratory and hold hands\\n with Pete. He'd appreciate it.\\\" He got the impression that the girl was\\n struggling heroically to refrain from laughing and that didn't help his\\n dignity any. He strode into the bathroom, slammed the door and climbed\\n back into the bath.\\n\\n\\n The door opened a little.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, good-by now.\\\" The girl said sweetly. \\\"Remember me to the police\\n force.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Get out of here!\\\" he yelled and the door shut abruptly on a rippling\\n burst of laughter. Damn women! It was getting so a man had to pack\\n a gun with him or something. And Pete Brent. He thought with grim\\n satisfaction of the unending extra work that was going to occur around\\n the laboratory from now on. He sank back into the soothing liquid\\n embrace of the bath and deliberately set his mind loose to wander in\\n complete relaxation.\\n\\n\\n A hammering thunder burst on the outer door. He sat up with a groan.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Lay off, you crazy apes!\\\" he yelled furiously, but the pounding\\n continued steadily. He struggled out of the bath, wrapped his damp\\n bathrobe clammily around him and marched to the door with a seething\\n fury of righteous anger burning within him. He flung the door wide, his\\n mouth all set for a withering barrage, but he didn't get a chance. Four\\n police constables and a sergeant swarmed into the room, shoving him\\n away from the door.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Say! What the\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Where is she?\\\" the sergeant demanded.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Wherethehell's who?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Quit stallin', bud. You know who. That female rebel who was in here.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Rebel? You're crazy! That was just ... Pete said ... rebel? Did you\\n say rebel?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yeah, I said rebel, an' where is she?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"She ... why ... why ... she left, of course. You don't think I was\\n going to have women running around in here, do you?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"She wuz in his bed when I seen her, sarge,\\\" one of the guards\\n contributed. \\\"But she ain't there now.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You don't think that I\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Listen, bud, we don't do the thinkin' around here. You come on along\\n and see the chief.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Brian had had about enough. \\\"I'm not going anywhere to see anybody.\\n Maybe you don't know who I am. You can't arrest me.\\\"\\nBrian Hanson, Chief of Research for Venus Consolidated, as dignified as\\n possible in a damp bathrobe, glared out through the bars at a slightly\\n bewildered Pete Brent.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What the devil do you want? Haven't you caused enough blasted trouble\\n already?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Me? For gosh sakes, chief\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Yes, you! If sending that damn blonde to my apartment and getting me\\n arrested is your idea of a joke\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"But, my gosh, I didn't send anybody, chief. And this is no joke.\\n That wasn't Myrtle, that was Crystal James, old man James' daughter.\\n They're about the oldest family on Venus. Police have been after her\\n for months; she's a rebel and she's sure been raising plenty of hell\\n around here. She got in and blew out the main communications control\\n panel last night. Communications been tied up all day.\\\" Pete lowered\\n his voice to an appreciative whisper, \\\"Gosh, chief, I didn't know you\\n had it in you. How long have you been in with that bunch? Is that girl\\n as good-looking as they say she is?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Now listen here, Brent. I don't know\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, it's all right, chief. You can trust me. I won't give you away.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"There's nothing to give away, you fool!\\\" Brian bellowed. \\\"I don't know\\n anything about any damn rebels. All I want is to get out of here\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Gotcha, chief,\\\" Brent whispered understandingly. \\\"I'll see if I can\\n pass the word along.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Come here, you idiot!\\\" Brian screamed after his erstwhile assistant.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Pipe down there, bud,\\\" a guard's voice cut in chillingly.\\n\\n\\n Brian retired to his cell bunk and clutched his aching head in\\n frustrated fury.\\n\\n\\n For the nineteenth time Brian Hanson strode to the door of his cell and\\n rattled the bars.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Listen here, guard, you've got to take a message to McHague. You can't\\n hold me here indefinitely.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Shut up. Nobody ain't takin' no message to McHague. I don't care if\\n you are\\u2014\\\"\\n\\n\\n Brian's eyes almost popped out as he saw a gloved hand reach around\\n the guard's neck and jam a rag over his nose and mouth. Swift shadows\\n moved expertly before his astonished gaze. Another guard was caught and\\n silenced as he came around the end of the corridor. Someone was outside\\n his cell door, a hooded figure which seemed, somehow, familiar.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Hello, pantless!\\\" a voice breathed.\\n\\n\\n He knew that voice!\\n\\n\\n \\\"What the devil are you doing here?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Somebody by the name of Pete Brent tipped us off that you were in\\n trouble because of me. But don't worry, we're going to get you out.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Damn that fool kid! Leave me alone. I don't want to get out of here\\n that way!\\\" he yelled wildly. \\\"Guards! Help!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Shut up! Do you want to get us shot?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Sure I do. Guards! Guards!\\\"\\n\\n\\n Someone came running.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Guards are coming,\\\" a voice warned.\\n\\n\\n He could hear the girl struggling with the lock.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Damn,\\\" she swore viciously. \\\"This is the wrong key! Your goose is sure\\n cooked now. Whether you like it or not, you'll hang with us when they\\n find us trying to get you out of here.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Brian felt as though something had kicked him in the stomach. She was\\n right! He had to get out now. He wouldn't be able to explain this away.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Give me that key,\\\" he hissed and grabbed for it.\\n\\n\\n He snapped two of the coigns off in the lock and went to work with the\\n rest of the key. He had designed these escape-proof locks himself. In a\\n few seconds the door swung open and they were fleeing silently down the\\n jail corridor.\\n\\n\\n The girl paused doubtfully at a crossing passage.\\n\\n\\n \\\"This way,\\\" he snarled and took the lead. He knew the ground plan of\\n this jail perfectly. He had a moment of wonder at the crazy spectacle\\n of himself, the fair-haired boy of Venus Consolidated, in his flapping\\n bathrobe, leading a band of escaping rebels out of the company's best\\n jail.\\n\\n\\n They burst around a corner onto a startled guard.\\n\\n\\n \\\"They're just ahead of us,\\\" Brian yelled. \\\"Come on!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Right with you,\\\" the guard snapped and ran a few steps with them\\n before a blackjack caught up with him and he folded into a corner.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Down this way, it's a short cut.\\\" Brian led the way to a heavily\\n barred side door.\\n\\n\\n The electric eye tripped a screaming alarm, but the broken key in\\n Brian's hands opened the complicated lock in a matter of seconds. They\\n were outside the jail on a side street, the door closed and the lock\\n jammed immovably behind them.\\n\\n\\n Sirens wailed. The alarm was out! The street suddenly burst into\\n brilliance as the floodlights snapped on. Brian faltered to a stop and\\n Crystal James pushed past him.\\n\\n\\n \\\"We've got reinforcements down here,\\\" she said, then skidded to a halt.\\n Two guards barred the street ahead of them.\\n\\n\\n Brian felt as though his stomach had fallen down around his ankles\\n and was tying his feet up. He couldn't move. The door was jammed shut\\n behind them, they'd have to surrender and there'd be no explaining\\n this break. He started mentally cursing Pete Brent, when a projector\\n beam slashed viciously by him. These guards weren't fooling! He heard\\n a gasping grunt of pain as one of the rebels went down. They were\\n shooting to kill.\\n\\n\\n He saw a sudden, convulsive movement from the girl. A black object\\n curved out against the lights. The sharp, ripping blast of an atomite\\n bomb thundered along the street and slammed them to the ground. The\\n glare left them blinded. He struggled to his feet. The guards had\\n vanished, a shallow crater yawned in the road where they had been.\\n\\n\\n \\\"We've got to run!\\\" the girl shouted.\\n\\n\\n He started after her. Two surface transport vehicles waited around the\\n corner. Brian and the rebels bundled into them and took away with a\\n roar. The chase wasn't organized yet, and they soon lost themselves in\\n the orderly rush of Venus City traffic.\\nThe two carloads of rebels cruised nonchalantly past the Administration\\n Center and pulled into a private garage a little beyond.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What are we stopping here for?\\\" Brian demanded. \\\"We've got to get\\n away.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's just what we're doing,\\\" Crystal snapped. \\\"Everybody out.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The rebels piled out and the cars pulled away to become innocuous parts\\n of the traffic stream. The rebels seemed to know where they were going\\n and that gave them the edge on Brian. They followed Crystal down into\\n the garage's repair pit.\\n\\n\\n She fumbled in the darkness a moment, then a darker patch showed as\\n a door swung open in the side of the pit. They filed into the solid\\n blackness after her and the door thudded shut. The beam of a torch\\n stabbed through the darkness and they clambered precariously down a\\n steep, steel stairway.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Where the dickens are we?\\\" Brian whispered hoarsely.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, you don't have to whisper, we're safe enough here. This is one of\\n the air shafts leading down to the old mines.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Old mines? What old mines?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's something you newcomers don't know anything about. This whole\\n area was worked out long before Venus Consolidated came to the planet.\\n These old tunnels run all under the city.\\\"\\n\\n\\n They went five hundred feet down the air shaft before they reached a\\n level tunnel.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What do we do? Hide here?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"I should say not. Serono Zeburzac, head of McHague's secret police\\n will be after us now. We won't be safe anywhere near Venus City.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Don't be crazy. That Serono Zeburzac stuff is just a legend McHague\\n keeps up to scare people with.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's what you think,\\\" Crystal snapped. \\\"McHague's legend got my\\n father and he'll get all of us unless we run the whole company right\\n off the planet.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, what the dickens does he look like?\\\" Brian asked doubtfully.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I don't know, but his left hand is missing. Dad did some good shooting\\n before he died,\\\" she said grimly.\\n\\n\\n Brian was startled at the icy hardness of her voice.\\n\\n\\n Two of the rebels pulled a screening tarpaulin aside and revealed\\n one of the old-type ore cars that must have been used in the ancient\\n mines. A brand-new atomic motor gleamed incongruously at one end. The\\n rebels crowded into it and they went rumbling swiftly down the echoing\\n passage. The lights of the car showed the old working, rotten and\\n crumbling, fallen in in some places and signs of new work where the\\n rebels had cleared away the debris of years.\\n\\n\\n Brian struggled into a zippered overall suit as they followed a\\n twisting, tortuous course for half an hour, switching from one tunnel\\n to another repeatedly until he had lost all conception of direction.\\n Crystal James, at the controls, seemed to know exactly where they were\\n going.\\n\\n\\n The tunnel emerged in a huge cavern that gloomed darkly away in every\\n direction. The towering, massive remains of old machinery, eroded and\\n rotten with age crouched like ancient, watching skeletons.\\n\\n\\n \\\"These were the old stamp mills,\\\" the girl said, and her voice seemed\\n to be swallowed to a whisper in the vast, echoing darkness.\\n\\n\\n Between two rows of sentinel ruins they came suddenly on two slim\\n Venusian atmospheric ships. Dim light spilled over them from a ragged\\n gash in the wall of the cavern. Brian followed Crystal into the smaller\\n of the two ships and the rest of the rebels manned the other.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Wait a minute, how do we get out of here?\\\" Brian demanded.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Through that hole up there,\\\" the girl said matter-of-factly.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You're crazy, you can't get through there.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, yeah? Just watch this.\\\" The ship thundered to life beneath them\\n and leaped off in a full-throttled take-off.\\n\\n\\n \\\"We're going to crash! That gap isn't wide enough!\\\"\\n\\n\\n The sides of the gap rushed in on the tips of the stubby wings. Brian\\n braced himself for the crash, but it didn't come. At the last possible\\n second, the ship rolled smoothly over. At the moment it flashed through\\n the opening it was stood vertically on edge.\\nCrystal held the ship in its roll and completed the maneuver outside\\n the mountain while Brian struggled to get his internal economy back\\n into some semblance of order.\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's some flying,\\\" he said as soon as he could speak.\\n\\n\\n Crystal looked at him in surprise. \\\"That's nothing. We Venusians fly\\n almost as soon as we can walk.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh\\u2014I see,\\\" Brian said weakly and a few moments later he really did\\n see. Two big, fast, green ships, carrying the insignia of the Venus\\n Consolidated police, cruised suddenly out from a mountain air station.\\n\\n\\n An a\\u00ebrial torpedo exploded in front of the rebel ship. Crystal's face\\n set in grim lines as she pulled the ship up in a screaming climb. Brian\\n got up off the floor.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You don't have to get excited like that,\\\" he complained. \\\"They weren't\\n trying to hit us.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's what you think,\\\" Crystal muttered. \\\"Those children don't play\\n for peanuts.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"But, girl, they're just Venus Consolidated police. They haven't got\\n any authority to shoot anyone.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Authority doesn't make much difference to them,\\\" Crystal snapped\\n bitterly. \\\"They've been killing people all over the planet. What do you\\n think this revolution is about?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You must be mistak\\u2014\\\" He slumped to the floor as Crystal threw the\\n ship into a mad, rolling spin. A tremendous crash thundered close\\n astern.\\n\\n\\n \\\"I guess that was a mistake!\\\" Crystal yelled as she fought the controls.\\n\\n\\n Brian almost got to his feet when another wild maneuver hurled him back\\n to the floor. The police ship was right on their tail. The girl gunned\\n her craft into a snap Immelmann and swept back on their pursuers,\\n slicing in close over the ship. Brian's eyes bulged as he saw a long\\n streak of paint and metal ripped off the wing of the police ship. He\\n saw the crew battling their controls in startled terror. The ship\\n slipped frantically away and fell into a spin.\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's them,\\\" Crystal said with satisfaction. \\\"How are the others\\n doing?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Look! They're hit!\\\" Brian felt sick.\\nThe slower rebel freight ship staggered drunkenly as a torpedo caught\\n it and ripped away half a wing. It plunged down in flames with the\\n white flowers of half a dozen parachutes blossoming around it. Brian\\n watched in horror as the police ship came deliberately about. They\\n heard its forward guns go into action. The bodies of the parachutists\\n jerked and jumped like crazy marionettes as the bullets smashed into\\n them. It was over in a few moments. The dead rebels drifted down into\\n the mist-shrouded depths of the valley.\\n\\n\\n \\\"The dirty, murdering rats!\\\" Brian's voice ripped out in a fury of\\n outrage. \\\"They didn't have a chance!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Don't get excited,\\\" Crystal told him in a dead, flat voice. \\\"That's\\n just normal practice. If you'd stuck your nose out of your laboratory\\n once in a while, you'd have heard of these things.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"But why\\u2014\\\" He ducked away instinctively as a flight of bullets spanged\\n through the fuselage. \\\"They're after us now!\\\"\\n\\n\\n Crystal's answer was to yank the ship into a rocketing climb. The\\n police were watching for that. The big ship roared up after them.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Just follow along, suckers,\\\" Crystal invited grimly.\\n\\n\\n She snapped the ship into a whip stall. For one nauseating moment they\\n hung on nothing, then the ship fell over on its back and they screamed\\n down in a terminal velocity dive, heading for the safety of the lower\\n valley mists. The heavier police ship, with its higher wing-loading,\\n could not match the maneuver. The rebel craft plunged down through the\\n blinding fog. Half-seen, ghostly fingers of stone clutched up at them,\\n talons of gray rock missed and fell away again as Crystal nursed the\\n ship out of its dive.\\n\\n\\n \\\"\\nPhew!\\n\\\" Brian gasped. \\\"Well, we got away that time. How in thunder\\n can you do it?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, you don't do it on faith. Take a look at that fuel gauge! We\\n may get as far as our headquarters\\u2014or we may not.\\\"\\nFor twenty long minutes they groped blindly through the fog, flying\\n solely by instruments and dead reckoning. The needle of the fuel gauge\\n flickered closer and closer to the danger point. They tore loose from\\n the clinging fog as it swung firmly to \\\"Empty.\\\" The drive sputtered and\\n coughed and died.\\n\\n\\n \\\"That's figuring it nice and close,\\\" Crystal said in satisfaction. \\\"We\\n can glide in from here.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Into where?\\\" Brian demanded. All he could see immediately ahead was\\n the huge bulk of a mountain which blocked the entire width of the\\n valley and soared sheer up to the high-cloud level. His eyes followed\\n it up and up\\u2014\\n\\n\\n \\\"Look! Police ships. They've seen us!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Maybe they haven't. Anyway, there's only one place we can land.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The ship lunged straight for the mountain wall!\\n\\n\\n \\\"Are you crazy? Watch out\\u2014we'll crash!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You leave the flying to me,\\\" Crystal snapped.\\n\\n\\n She held the ship in its glide, aiming directly for the tangled foliage\\n of the mountain face. Brian yelped and cowered instinctively back. The\\n lush green of the mountainside swirled up to meet them. They ripped\\n through the foliage\\u2014there was no crash. They burst through into a\\n huge, brilliantly lighted cavern and settled to a perfect landing. Men\\n came running. Crystal tumbled out of her ship.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Douse those lights,\\\" she shouted. \\\"The police are outside.\\\"\\n\\n\\n A tall, lean man with bulbous eyes and a face like a startled horse,\\n rushed up to Crystal.\\n\\n\\n \\\"What do you mean by leading them here?\\\" he yelled, waving his hands.\\n\\n\\n \\\"They jumped us when we had no fuel, and quit acting like an idiot.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The man was shaking, his eyes looked wild. \\\"They'll kill us. We've got\\n to get out of here.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Wait, you fool. They may not even have seen us.\\\" But he was gone,\\n running toward a group of ships lined up at the end of the cavern.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Who was that crazy coot and what is this place?\\\" Brian demanded.\\n\\n\\n \\\"That was Gort Sterling, our leader,\\\" the girl said bitterly. \\\"And\\n this is our headquarters.\\\" One of the ships at the back of the cavern\\n thundered to life, streaked across the floor and burst out through the\\n opening Crystal's ship had left. \\\"He hasn't got a chance! We'll be\\n spotted for sure, now.\\\"\\n\\n\\n The other rebels waited uncertainly, but not for long. There was the\\n crescendoing roar of ships in a dive followed by the terrific crash of\\n an explosion.\\n\\n\\n \\\"They got him!\\\" Crystal's voice was a moan. \\\"Oh, the fool, the fool!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Sounded like more than one ship. They'll be after us, now. Is there\\n any other way of getting out of this place?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Not for ships. We'll have to walk and they'll follow us.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"We've got to slow them down some way, then. I wonder how the devil\\n they traced us? I thought we lost them in that fog.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It's that Serono Zeburzac, the traitor. He knows these mountains as\\n well as we do.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"How come?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"The Zeburzacs are one of the old families, but he sold out to McHague.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Well, what do we do now? Just stand here? It looks like everybody's\\n leaving.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"We might as well just wait,\\\" Crystal said hopelessly. \\\"It won't do us\\n any good to run out into the hills. Zeburzac and his men will follow.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"We could slow them down some by swinging a couple of those ships\\n around so their rocket exhausts sweep the entrance to the cavern,\\\"\\n Brian suggested doubtfully. She looked at him steadily.\\n\\n\\n \\\"You sound like the only good rebel left. We can try it, anyway.\\\"\\nThey ran two ships out into the middle of the cavern, gunned them\\n around and jockeyed them into position\\u2014not a moment too soon.\\n\\n\\n Half a dozen police showed in brief silhouette as they slipped\\n cautiously into the cavern, guns ready, expecting resistance. They met\\n a dead silence. A score or more followed them without any attempt at\\n concealment. Then Brian and Crystal cut loose with the drives of the\\n two ships.\\n\\n\\n Startled screams of agony burst from the crowded group of police as\\n they were caught in the annihilating cross fire of roaring flame.\\n They crisped and twisted, cooked to scorched horrors before they\\n fell. A burst of thick, greasy smoke rushed out of the cavern. Two of\\n the police, their clothes and flesh scorched and flaming, plunged as\\n shrieking, living torches down the mountainside.\\n\\n\\n Crystal was white and shaking, her face set in a mask of horror, as she\\n climbed blindly from her ship.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Let's get away! I can smell them burning,\\\" she shuddered and covered\\n her face with her hands.\\n\\n\\n Brian grabbed her and shook her.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Snap out of it,\\\" he barked. \\\"That's no worse than shooting helpless\\n men in parachutes. We can't go, yet; we're not finished here.\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Oh, let them shoot us! I can't go through that again!\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"You don't have to. Wait here.\\\"\\n\\n\\n He climbed back into one of the ships and cut the richness of the fuel\\n mixture down till the exhaust was a lambent, shuddering stutter,\\n verging on extinction. He dashed to the other ship and repeated the\\n maneuver, fussing with the throttle till he had the fuel mixture\\n adjusted to critical fineness. The beat of the stuttering exhaust\\n seemed to catch up to the other and built to an aching pulsation. In\\n a moment the whole mass of air in the cavern hit the frequency with a\\n subtle, intangible thunder of vibration.\\n\\n\\n Crystal screamed. \\\"Brian! There's more police cutting in around the\\n entrance.\\\"\\n\\n\\n Brian clambered out of the ship and glanced at the glowing points\\n in the rock where the police were cutting their way through outside\\n the line of the exhaust flames. The pulsating thunder in the cavern\\n crescendoed to an intolerable pitch. A huge mass of stalactites crashed\\n to the floor.\\n\\n\\n \\\"It's time to check out,\\\" Brian shouted.\\n\\n\\n Crystal led the way as they fled down the escape tunnel. The roaring\\n crash of falling rock was a continuous, increasing avalanche of sound\\n in the cavern behind them.\\n\\n\\n They emerged from the tunnel on the face of the mountain, several\\n hundred yards to the east of the cavern entrance. The ground shook and\\n heaved beneath them.\\n\\n\\n \\\"The whole side of the mountain's sliding,\\\" Crystal screamed.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Run!\\\" Brian shoved her and they plunged madly through the thick tangle\\n of jungle away from the slide.\\n\\n\\n Huge boulders leaped and smashed through the matted bush around them.\\n Crystal went down as the ground slipped from under her. Brian grabbed\\n her and a tree at the same time. The tree leaned and crashed down the\\n slope, the whole jungle muttered and groaned and came to life as it\\n joined the roaring rush of the slide. They were tumbled irresistibly\\n downward, riding the edge of the slide for terrifying minutes till\\n it stilled and left them bruised and shaken in a tangle of torn\\n vegetation.\\n\\n\\n The remains of two police ships, caught without warning in the rush as\\n they attempted to land, stuck up grotesquely out of the foot of the\\n slide. The dust was settling away. A flock of brilliant blue, gliding\\n lizards barking in raucous terror, fled down the valley. Then they were\\n gone and the primeval silence settled back into place.\\n\\n\\n Brian and Crystal struggled painfully to solid ground. Crystal gazed\\n with a feeling of awe at the devastated mountainside.\\n\\n\\n \\\"How did you do it?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"It's a matter of harmonics,\\\" Brian explained. \\\"If you hit the right\\n vibratory combination, you can shake anything down. But now that we've\\n made a mess of the old homestead, what do we do?\\\"\\n\\n\\n \\\"Walk,\\\" Crystal said laconically. She led the way as they started\\n scrambling through the jungle up the mountainside.\\n\\n\\n \\\"Where are we heading for?\\\" Brian grunted as he struggled along.\\n\\n\\n \\\"The headquarters of the Carlton family. They're the closest people we\\n can depend on. They've kept out of the rebellion, but they're on our\\n side.
